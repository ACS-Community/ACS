This file contains notes useful when preparing a new ACS release.

- The main version and patch level files are:
     ACS_PATCH_LEVEL
     ACS_VERSION
  They have to be updated by hand.
  Notice that the file ACS_TAG is instead generated automatically
  by the build procedure.

- There are a few files that have hardcoded releases and version
  numbers.
  These files need to be updated whenever the ACS release number
  changes:
  - ACS/LGPL/acsBUILD/config/rc.d/init.d/acsDHCPConfig
    This file is executed as root at boot time and therefore 
    there is no clean way to rely on environment variables.
    Remember to update rc.d/init.d/acsDHCPConfig on the installed
    machines.
  - ACS/ExtProd/INSTALL/buildRTOS
    This file contains hardcoded the tag for 
    checking-out RTOS (3rdParty/linux and
    3rdParty/rtai).
- Do not forget to update the reference files for  
  the acsConfigReport tool in the ACS/LGPL/Kit/acs module
- Check 
       ACS/ExtProd/INSTALL/README.first 
  for notes about building the basic external ACS tools.
