The labm environment is intended for use on a VxWorks LCU. 


Before pkginBuild is used to create this environment, the ACC host
database needs to have the following entries:

INSERT INTO prog_environment VALUES ('labm'  ,'','LCU',2160,'<LCU host
name>','','','',0 )\g

INSERT INTO lcu_progenv VALUES ('labm'  ,'<Boot Workstation host
environment name>' ) \g

The following files should also be customized for the local network configuration
in which the LCU exists:

bootScript:
Replace the host "jemez" and its IP address with the boot workstation
for the LCU.
Replace the hosts "condor" and "blacktail" with the hosts running the
name service and the MACI manager, respectively. 

userScript:
Replace "blacktail" with the host location of the wacc environment. If
the workstations are on a different subnet from the LCU, then change
the "routeAdd" command to the appropriate routing information.

dbl/USER.db
change the ManagerReference attribute of the abm1 Activator to point
to the host where the manager will be executed.
