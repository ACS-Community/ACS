2011-01-21 htischer ws/src/Makefile robusteness and support to create new patch version on source updates

	- on 'make clean_dist' create a new patch version including sourcecode updates
	- on unpack/patch/clean do not overwrite sourcecode updates
	- Allow build with 'make all' and allow 'make clean' without reconfiguring 
	  and without overwriting source modifications done after unpacking.
	- build output more self descriptive
