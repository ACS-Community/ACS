	* doxy-1.2.13.1.linux.bin.tar.gz
        * doxy-1.2.13.1.src.tar.gz
	Patched lex scanner to handle ACS_THROW_SPEC macros.
	The file dox-1.2.13.1/src/scanner.l has been modified in the
	following way (diff output):

	2204,2209d2203
< <FuncQual>{BN}*"ACE_THROW_SPEC"{BN}*"("		{ 
<   					  current->exception = " throw (" ;
< 					  roundCount=0;
< 					  lineCount() ;
< 					  BEGIN( ExcpRound ) ;
< 					}
3845,3848d3838
<   					  current->exception = "throw(";
< 					  BEGIN(ClassDocFuncExc);
<   					}
< <ClassDocFuncQual>"ACE_THROW_SPEC"{B}*"("	{


	i.e. tokens for the macro have been added, just identical to the
	normal throw tokens.

	The linux binaries have been rebuilt and the linux binaries and
	src tar files regenerated and renamed *-patch.* to ensure the
	patch is clearly documented.
	Makefile and install_script have been changed just to handle the
	new "patch version number"

	This same simple change will have to be done if new versions are
	taken from the original doxygen distribution.
	Emails have been sent to Doxygen and ACE/TAO.
