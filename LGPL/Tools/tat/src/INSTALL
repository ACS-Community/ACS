1. expect installation
----------------------

tat needs expect that is a specialized tcl shell allowing to talk
to interactive programs. To install it, you need expect sources
and tcl sources :

- expect is located under $VLTSCCM/PRODUCTS/tcltk/expect5.19.0tar
- tcl is located under $VLTSCCM/PRODUCTS/tcltk/tcl7.4.tar

Untar the two tar files in the same directory:

tar xf expect5.19.0.tar
tar xf tcltk/tcl7.4.tar

Execute:

cd expect-5.19
./configure
make clean
make expect
make install

The Makefile should find automatically the tcl sources and install
the expect program under /usr/local/bin.

To test that the installation is successfull:

# don't use the binary generated under the expect-5.16 directory
cd $HOME
expect
expect1.1> exp_version
5.16.3
expect1.2> exit

2. Environment pools installation
---------------------------------

tat allocates dynamically environment for (RTAP) workstations and LCUs. 
These environments are taken from pools that need to be installed by hand.

2.1 RTAP environments

Choose the number of RTAP environment that will run at the same time on
a given workstation (10 is the maximum).

A tat environment name is built by concatenating <host_string> and
<env_number>:

- if your hostname starts with 'w' then host_string is made up
of the six first characters of host name.
- if your host name does not start with 'w', then set the first character
 of host_string to 'w' and add the first 5 letters of host name.
- env_number ranges always from '0' to '9'

Each environment should be added to
- the acc/vcc database with the flag attic set to 1
- $RTAPROOT/etc/RtapEnvList 
- /etc/services

2.2 LCU environments

The LCU pool is global to your local network because a LCU is not dedicated
to one workstation. You need to have one directory NFS mounted on every
workstation where tests will be run:

mkdir <LCUpoolPath>
chmod g+w <LCUpathPath>

for each LCU dedicated to automated testing:
touch <LCUpoolPath>/<LCU environment name>

Note: <LCU environment name> is the name of the LCU prefixed with an 'l'.

Add in your standard environment definition on each workstation:
setenv LCUROOT <LCUpoolPath>

3. Install the tat module
-------------------------

cmmCopy tat <version number>
cd tat/src
make clean all man install


Note: tat uses the sequencer, installed with the VLT software and the
vcc database to create LCU/WS/RWS environments.
