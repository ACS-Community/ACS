# HSO 2010-10: We currently support antrl versions 2 and 3. 
# Version 3.0.1 is needed for oAW v.5, but only for java, which is all we install. The currently latest version 3.2 does not work. 
# Since the build from source requires maven, we currently just install the pre-built jar file. 
# Note that the java packages are unique so that no version conflict can arise. 
# TODO: Check who all still uses version 2, and especially if C++ support is still needed.
#       Try to build also ANTLR_VER_3 from source.
ANTLR_VER_2 = 2.7.7
ANTLR_VER_3 = 3.0.1
