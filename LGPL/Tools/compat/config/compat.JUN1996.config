#   NAME
#   compat.config - Configuration file to check for incompatibilies of JUN96
#
#   DESCRIPTION
#   This files contains a number of entries, with each entry describing a single
#   incompatibilitiy.  Each entry is structured as a keyed list (see TclX)
#   The format of each entry is:
#      1. Opening braces
#      2. A number of sublists each containing a key and a value;
#      3. Closing braces
#   Being keyed lists, the exact order of the sublists (see 2.) is irrelevant.
#   The keys are:
#   TYPE : tells whether the incompatibility stems from the "filename" or 
#          from the "content" of the file
#   PATTERN : glob-style pattern to match.  No need to use "*" if TYPE is
#             "content" -- the asterisks are added by compat.tcl in this case
#   LEVEL : classification of incompatibility.  WARNING means potentially
#           incompatible, SEVERE means a hard incompatibility.
#   HELP : a short explanatory help text
#
#   Comment or blank lines can appear anywhere outside the braces enclosing one
#   entry (1. and 3.)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
