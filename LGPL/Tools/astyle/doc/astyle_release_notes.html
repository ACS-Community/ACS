		</UL>
		<H3>In Artistic Style 1.13.0&nbsp;(27 September 1999)</H3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Moved back to odd-minor-numbered development versions, and even-minor-numbered 
			stable versions.
			<li>
			Added the new option '--break-blocks' which breaks apart unrelated blocks, 
			labels, classes, etc.
			<li>
			Added the new option '--break-blocks=all' which also breaks apart blocks of 
			closing headers, such as 'else', 'catch', etc.
			<li>
			Fixed indentation handling of labels and class-definition identifiers such as 
			'public:', 'protected:', ... (thanks to Daryn Adler for his patch)
			<li>
			Fixed indentation of nested class definitions. (thanks to Daryn Adler for his 
			patch)
			<li>
				Added the new option '--indent-preprocessor' which (surprisingly) tries to 
				reindent C/C++ preprocessor macro lines. Astyle should do an pretty nice 
				indentation job if the macro code is sane, but don't expect miracales for 
				horrid macro definitions...</li></ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.11.6&nbsp;(27 September 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Improved indentation of lines containing single-line blocks.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.11.5&nbsp;(25 September 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Improved the bugfix for a 'const' keyword bug which resulted in wrong 
				indentation of methods that are declared const.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.11.4&nbsp;(18 September 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Improved handling of single colons (':') in class headers, e.g. class Foo : 
			public Bar { ... }
			<li>
				Improved handling of single colons (':') in method (constructor) headers, e.g. 
				Foo::Foo(int a) : Bar(a)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.11.3&nbsp;(16 September 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed a serious bug in the formatting of brackets, introduced in 1.11.2.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.11.2&nbsp;(10 September 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed an indentation bug in statements that contain the 'const', that resulted 
			in wrong indentation of array blocks that where declared const. (Thanks 
			Daniel!)
			<li>
			Fixed an indentation bug that could arise in lines that appear immediately 
			after several preprocessor commands. (Thanks Daniel!).
			<li>
			Fixed a bug that inserted an empty line after closing brackets if a comment 
			appeared immediately prior to the closing bracket. (Thanks Ed!)
			<li>
				Fixed a bug that eliminated empty lines between closing brackets and 
				immediately following opening brackets. (Thanks Ed!)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.11.1&nbsp;(3 September 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed a bug that inserted an empty line at the begining of source files.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.11.0&nbsp;(3 September 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Astyle now filters out linefeeds ('\r') before begining to parse lines. This 
			should take care of bizzare formatting that existed when moving source files 
			from Windows (which breaks lines with a linefeed AND newline ("\r\n") to unix 
			(which breaks lines only with newlines).
			<li>
			The "struct", "static" and "synchronized" keywords are now finally handled 
			correctly in both the contexts of block headers AND simple keywords.
			<li>
			Better treatment of precompiler lines that end with backslashes, and the lines 
			that immediately follow them.
			<li>
			The '--indent-classes' (or '-C') option now works correctly (again...).
			<li>
				Series of short command-line options (e.g. "-b -s4 -C") are now parsed 
				correctly.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.10.4&nbsp;(27 July 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed a MAJOR bug (inserted in 1.10.3) that resulted wrong handling of 
				double-colons ('::') in C++.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.10.3&nbsp;(24 July 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed a bug (inserted yesterday) that resulted in unwanted line breaks before 
			closing-brackets.
			<li>
			Fixed a bug in the handling of 'static' blocks in java.
			<li>
			Added the new option '--indent-cases' (or '-K') for indenting 'case XXX:' lines 
			so they are flush with their following code lines.
			<li>
				Added the new option '--fill-empty-lines' (or '-E') which fills empty lines 
				with the white-space of their previous line.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.10.2&nbsp;(23 July 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed a series of related bugs that resulted in certain cases of lacking line 
				breaks after close-brackets, and colons. Thanks Jeroen!</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.10.1&nbsp;(18 July 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed a bug (introduced in astyle 1.10.0) that can result in missing line 
				breaks before closing brackets if they appear immediately after comments. 
				Thanks Larry!</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.10.0&nbsp;Release (14 July 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Improved handling of empty bracket blocks ( e.g.{ } ). Thanks Michael!</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.10.0&nbsp;Prerelease (4 July 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed a bug in the in-statement indentation algorithm which resulted in 
			sub-optimal indentation of multiple-line conditional statements that 
			immediately follow headers such as 'if', 'else if', 'while', etc... As a 
			result, the current in-statement indentation is finally what it should have 
			been long ago - MUCH better then in the last stable versions.
			<li>
			The "linux" bracket style (in which definition brackets are broken while code 
			brackets are attached) has been fixed, and should finally work correctly.
			<li>
			Artistic Style can now parse both C/C++ and Java files in the same command. 
			Unless a specific language mode is specified (e.g. --style=java or --style=c), 
			astyle will now automatically set the language mode according to each file's 
			suffix (java mode for the '.java' suffix , c mode&nbsp; otherwise).
			<li>
			Multiple statements in a single line (e.g. aaa; bbb; fff;) are now broken up by 
			default.
			<li>
				Added the option '<strong>--one-line=keep-statement</strong>s' (or '<strong>-o</strong>') 
			that keeps multiple statements in a single line attached, thus countering the 
			default break detailed above.
			<li>
				Changed the option previously called '<strong>--keep-one-line-blocks</strong>' 
				to '<strong>--one-line=keep-blocks</strong>', for similarity with the new 
			option above.
			<li>
				Changed the short option name of the option '-<strong>-errors-to-standard-output</strong>' 
				from '<strong>-o</strong>' to '<strong>-X</strong>'.
			<li>
				Up to now, Artistic Style always inserted a minimal indent of <strong>t</strong>wice 
				the current selected indent size<strong> </strong>inside multi-line conditional 
				headers ('if', 'while' ...), so that it would be clear where the headers end 
				and the code after them begins. The current version adds the option '<strong>--min-conditional-indent=#</strong>' 
				(or '<strong>-m#</strong>') that sets the absolute minimal indent between 
				conditional headers and their multiple-line conditional statements. If this 
				option is not specified, the default indent remains <strong>twice the current 
					selected indent size</strong>.<br>
				For example, This option should come very handy in code that already has 
				brackets after EVERY conditional statement (even if just one line is in that 
				bracket...) - in such a case, it would be wise to set <strong>--min-conditional-indent=0
				</strong>
			since the brackets already make it clear where the header ends and the code 
			begins...
			<li>
				Added the ability to set the assumed tab size when in '<strong>--indent-tab</strong>' 
				mode by using '<strong>--indent-tab=#</strong>' or '<strong>-t#</strong>' and 
				replacing the <strong>#</strong> with the wanted size. If the size is not 
				specified, the size of each tab is assumed to be 4 spaces long.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.8.2&nbsp;(18 March 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed pointer handling problems in ASBeautifier that led to crashes when 
			parsing preprocessor commands.
			<li>
			Fixed the problem in locating the default options file in the directory pointed 
			to by $HOME or %HOMEPATH% when these system variables do not contain an '/' (or 
			'\' ...) at their end.
			<li>
			Fixed inverse insertion of spaces vs. tabs when in -t mode. (Thanks Brian!)
			<li>
				Got rid of those pesky C4786 warnings when compiling under Visual C++ (Thanks 
				John!)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.8.1&nbsp;(9 March 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Changed the '--style=k&amp;r' option to '--style= kr' , so that linux/unix 
				machines don't misinterpret the '&amp;' as a background processing command.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.8.0&nbsp;(3 March 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Added support for predefined styles. Current supported styles are: <strong>ansi, 
					k&amp;r, linux, gnu, java</strong>. these can be set by using 
			'--style=THESTYLE' (e.g. '--style=linux').
			<li>
				Added '--indent-blocks' (or -G) option, which <strong>adds indentation to entire 
					blocks</strong>, including their brackets, in similar fashion to the 
			standard gnu style.
			<li>
				Added option '--brackets=linux' (or '-l') which <strong>breaks definition-block 
					brackets, but attaches command-block brackets</strong>.
			<li>
			Padding can now be set separately for operators alone('-p' or '--pad=oper'), 
			parentheses alone ('--pad=paren) or both ('-P' or '--pad=all').
			<li>
				Artistic Style looks for a default options file in the following order:<br>
				1. The contents of the <strong>ARTISTIC_STYLE_OPTIONS</strong> environment 
				variable if it exists.<br>
				2. The file called .astylerc in the directory pointed to by the <strong>HOME</strong>
				environment variable ( i.e. <strong>$HOME/.astylerc</strong> ).<br>
				3. The file called .astylerc in the directory pointed to by the <strong>HOMEPATH</strong>
				environment variable ( i.e. <strong>%HOMEPATH%\.astylerc</strong> ).<br>
			If a default options file is found, the options in this file will be parsed 
			BEFORE the command-line options. Options within the default option file may be 
			written without the preliminary '-' or '--'. Indentation within #if , #else and 
			#endif precompiler commands now works correctly even if the program lines 
			between these precompiler commands contain non-pared brackets.
			<li>
				Improved handling of labels (e.g. 'exit:'). By default, labels are now flushed 
				completely to the left. Labels can also be indented to one indent LESS than 
				current standard indentation by using the new option '--indent-labels' (or 
				'-L') .
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed handling of the 'operator' keyword when it is preceded by a non space 
			character (such as '&amp;' or '*').
			<li>
			Fixed wrong bracket handling after 'throws' statements.
			<li>
			Fixed wrong indentation of single-line blocks. These where indented 1 indent to 
			much.
			<li>
			Fixed wrong indentation of headers in internal classes (java mode). These where 
			indented 1 indent to little.
			<li>
			The option ' --errors-to-standard-output' now has the one-letter option '-o'.
			<li>
				Fixed bug which resulted in an unneeded indent in function-declarations in 
				which function-variables are declared before the function declaration and are 
				preceded by the 'static' keyword. Thanks Scott.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.6.0&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 January 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed zero indentation that resulted when a '-suffix' option was set after a 
			'--indent=spaces' (or '-s') option..
			<li>
			Wrong options are now announced.
			<li>
				Changed default indentation to NOT automatically indent class blocks and switch 
				blocks. Instead, the new options '--indent-classes' (or '-C') and 
				'--indent-switches' (or '-S') should be used. The option '--indent-switches' 
				replaces the old option '--flush-switches'.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; (4 January 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Fixed ability to write options without the preceding '--' in the default 
			options file.
			<li>
			Added one-letter options to most options that had only long-options in version 
			1.4.0 .
			<li>
				Added a '-v' or '--version' option that writes the current Artistic Style 
				version.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.4.0&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 January 1999)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>MAJOR NEW CHANGE IN THE FORMAT OF OPTIONS:</strong><br>
				Options are now either <strong>short one-letter options</strong> starting with 
				'-', or <strong>long multi-letter options</strong> starting with '--'. The 
				Short one-letter options MAY BE ATTACHED TOGETHER. Thus, writing '-bps4' is the 
				same as writing '-b -p -s4'.<br>
			Many options that have up to now had a 2 letter format now retain only their 
			long format. I truly believe that the combination of attached-one-letter 
			options PLUS a default option's file containing long-letter-options related to 
			style will be much easier to work with than the previous setup.
			<li>
				Added support for <strong>a default options file</strong> (pointed to by the <strong>
					ARTISTIC_STYLE_OPTIONS environment variable</strong>).
			<li>
			Changed downloading method from the server. From now, there will be specific 
			directories containing the latest stable sources, stable binaries, and 
			development sources.
			<li>
			Space padding ('-p' or '--pad') now works correctly (1) around semicolons and 
			commas, (2) between headers that require parentheses after them (such as 'if', 
			'while'...)and those parentheses, and (3) after parentheses (unless immediately 
			followed by a ';' or ',' or '.') .
			<li>
			From now on, namespace blocks are NOT indented by default. To indent namespace 
			blocks use the new '--indent-namespaces' option.
			<li>
			Added options '--errors-to-standard-output' for redirection of standard-error 
			to standard-output from within Artistic Style, and '--suffix=' for specifying a 
			suffix other than '.orig' to append to original filenames..
			<li>
				Corrected indentation of 'default' in switch statements. (Up to now, this only 
				worked correctly in java mode...).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.2.0&nbsp;&nbsp; (19 December 1998)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Artistic Style 1.2.0 is the first stable result of a new version numbering, in 
			which development versions are numbered with an odd minor number (such as 
			1.1.x), and stable versions are numbered with an even number (1.2.x). Thus, 
			version 1.2.0 accumulates all the additions/changes of the 1.1.x development 
			versions of Artistic Style.
			<li>
			A new '-ol' formatting mode that eliminates breaking of one-line blocks.
			<li>
			Fixed a SERIOUS bug, which resulted in wrong formatting of brackets ('{', '}') 
			that came IMMEDIATELY AFTER definition type brackets, (e.g. brackets that come 
			right after 'class', 'interface', 'name-space', etc ...). This bug was 
			mistakenly introduced when I set out to correctly space-pad pointer and 
			reference signs, somewhere in version 0.9.x .
			<li>
			Fixed unwanted elimination of final empty lines.
			<li>
			Fixed broken indentation of virgin opening-brackets that occur immediately 
			after a previous closing-bracket.
			<li>
				Fixed space-padding to not insert a space in front of ':' characters unless 
				they are a part of a '? ... : ' statement.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.0.5&nbsp;&nbsp; (11 December 1998)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			'extern' blocks now handled correctly.
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Fixed handling of ^= in '-p' mode.
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
				Win32 executables now contain wildcard expansion. *** Look at the README.TXT 
				for info on how to include wildcard expansion abilities when compiling Artistic 
				Style under Win32. (Thanks for the info on wildcard-expansion enabling, Nat!!!)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.0.4&nbsp;&nbsp; (2 December 1998)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
				Fixed unwanted space-padding around urinary minuses and '-' symbols within 
				exponents (e.g. 2.5E-5) when using the '-p' option.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.0.3&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 December 1998)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">

			Fixed a SERIOUS bug, which lacked a needed line-break between&nbsp; closing 
			brackets&nbsp; and the headers that follow them (e.g. '} else') when in '-bb' 
			mode. In fixing the bug, I used a variation on a patch sent by Richard 
			Bullington - THANKS!

		<h3>In Artistic Style 1.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp; (24 November 1998)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
				Indented files now <b><u>retain the original file name</u></b>, while the 
				original pre-indented file is saved with a ".orig"at its end. Thus, after the

				Cleaner, more robust, and better documented source code.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 0.9.2</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Fixed a serious bug which led to a maximal supported source code line size of 
			128 characters!!!
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Maximal supported line size is now 1024 characters.
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Fixed a serious bug in the handling of brackets inside '#define' statements.
			<li>

				&lt;foo_dir/foo&gt; ) where space-padded when using option '-p' on C, C++ 
				files.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 0.9.1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Much improved space-padding around pointers ('*') and references ('&amp;') and 
			the 'operator' key-word&nbsp; in C and C++ source files when using the '-p' 
			space padding option.
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Fixed several pointer handling bugs which led to potential core dumps.
			<li>
				Version 0.9.1 now includes all the abilities I am planning for the final 1.0 
				version, and <b><u>should be looked at as the first pre-release version of Artistic 
						Style</u></b>.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In Artistic Style 0.9.0</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
				Added a <b>formatting layer</b>
			(ASFormatter.cpp) around the indentation layer (ASBeautifier.cpp).
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			As a result, the following formatting capabilities have been added:
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
					Bracket ('{' and '}') placement in either ANSI C style or Java style.
					<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
						Space padding around operators, i.e. (1+2)*3-4 becomes ( 1 + 2 ) * 3 - 4 .</li>
				</ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Fixed the 'tab' elimination bug introduced in ASBeautifier 0.8.2 .

		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Fixed indentation problem in brackets around 'struct', and 'union' blocks.
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Added recognition for '\' characters in the end of lines.
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			Improved indentation of post-method-declaration variable initializations.
			<li>
				Several minor bug fixes.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In ASBeautifier 0.8.1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed an important bug in pointer arithmetic which resulted both in phantom 
				indentation errors, and in core-dumps when trying to indent java files.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In ASBeautifier 0.8.0</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			This is the first public release of ASBeautifier. It is a direct port to C++ of 
			JSBeautifier 1.1.1, PLUS extensions to for C++ indentation.
			<li style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">
			So far, very little beta-testing has been done for the C++ extensions. This 
			should change extremely with the open-source release (this was the case with 
			JSBeautifier...), so expect ASBeautifier to become bug-free fast!!!
			<li>
				The C++ source code is not yet written in optimal quality. I rushed a little so 
				that I could release this initial release as soon as possible. This will soon 
				change.</li>
