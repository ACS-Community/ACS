Advanced Features of Argument Lists
-----------------------------------

   Our simple sample function, `(lambda (a b c) (+ a b c))', specifies
three argument variables, so it must be called with three arguments: if
you try to call it with only two arguments or four arguments, you get a
`wrong-number-of-arguments' error.

   It is often convenient to write a function that allows certain
arguments to be omitted.  For example, the function `substring' accepts
three arguments--a string, the start index and the end index--but the
third argument defaults to the LENGTH of the string if you omit it.  It
is also convenient for certain functions to accept an indefinite number
of arguments, as the functions `list' and `+' do.

   To specify optional arguments that may be omitted when a function is
called, simply include the keyword `&optional' before the optional
arguments.  To specify a list of zero or more extra arguments, include
the keyword `&rest' before one final argument.

   Thus, the complete syntax for an argument list is as follows:

     (REQUIRED-VARS...
      [&optional OPTIONAL-VARS...]
      [&rest REST-VAR])

The square brackets indicate that the `&optional' and `&rest' clauses,
and the variables that follow them, are optional.

   A call to the function requires one actual argument for each of the
REQUIRED-VARS.  There may be actual arguments for zero or more of the
OPTIONAL-VARS, and there cannot be any actual arguments beyond that
unless the lambda list uses `&rest'.  In that case, there may be any
number of extra actual arguments.

   If actual arguments for the optional and rest variables are omitted,
then they always default to `nil'.  There is no way for the function to
distinguish between an explicit argument of `nil' and an omitted
argument.  However, the body of the function is free to consider `nil'
an abbreviation for some other meaningful value.  This is what
`substring' does; `nil' as the third argument to `substring' means to
use the length of the string supplied.

     Common Lisp note: Common Lisp allows the function to specify what
     default value to use when an optional argument is omitted; Emacs
     Lisp always uses `nil'.

   For example, an argument list that looks like this:

     (a b &optional c d &rest e)

binds `a' and `b' to the first two actual arguments, which are
required.  If one or two more arguments are provided, `c' and `d' are
bound to them respectively; any arguments after the first four are
collected into a list and `e' is bound to that list.  If there are only
two arguments, `c' is `nil'; if two or three arguments, `d' is `nil';
if four arguments or fewer, `e' is `nil'.

   There is no way to have required arguments following optional
ones--it would not make sense.  To see why this must be so, suppose
that `c' in the example were optional and `d' were required.  Suppose
three actual arguments are given; which variable would the third
argument be for?  Similarly, it makes no sense to have any more
arguments (either required or optional) after a `&rest' argument.

   Here are some examples of argument lists and proper calls:

     ((lambda (n) (1+ n))                ; One required:
      1)                                 ; requires exactly one argument.
          => 2
     ((lambda (n &optional n1)           ; One required and one optional:
              (if n1 (+ n n1) (1+ n)))   ; 1 or 2 arguments.
      1 2)
          => 3
     ((lambda (n &rest ns)               ; One required and one rest:
              (+ n (apply '+ ns)))       ; 1 or more arguments.
      1 2 3 4 5)
          => 15

Documentation Strings of Functions
----------------------------------

   A lambda expression may optionally have a "documentation string" just
after the lambda list.  This string does not affect execution of the
function; it is a kind of comment, but a systematized comment which
actually appears inside the Lisp world and can be used by the Emacs help
facilities.  *Note Documentation::, for how the DOCUMENTATION-STRING is
accessed.

   It is a good idea to provide documentation strings for all commands,
and for all other functions in your program that users of your program
should know about; internal functions might as well have only comments,
since comments don't take up any room when your program is loaded.

   The first line of the documentation string should stand on its own,
because `apropos' displays just this first line.  It should consist of
one or two complete sentences that summarize the function's purpose.

   The start of the documentation string is usually indented, but since
these spaces come before the starting double-quote, they are not part of
the string.  Some people make a practice of indenting any additional
lines of the string so that the text lines up in the program source.
*This is a mistake.*  The indentation of the following lines is inside
the string; what looks nice in the source code will look ugly when
displayed by the help commands.

   You may wonder how the documentation string could be optional, since
there are required components of the function that follow it (the body).
Since evaluation of a string returns that string, without any side
effects, it has no effect if it is not the last form in the body.
Thus, in practice, there is no confusion between the first form of the
body and the documentation string; if the only body form is a string
then it serves both as the return value and as the documentation.

Naming a Function
=================

   In most computer languages, every function has a name; the idea of a
function without a name is nonsensical.  In Lisp, a function in the
strictest sense has no name.  It is simply a list whose first element is
`lambda', or a primitive subr-object.

   However, a symbol can serve as the name of a function.  This happens
when you put the function in the symbol's "function cell" (*note Symbol
Components::.).  Then the symbol itself becomes a valid, callable
function, equivalent to the list or subr-object that its function cell
refers to.  The contents of the function cell are also called the
symbol's "function definition".  The procedure of using a symbol's
function definition in place of the symbol is called "symbol function
indirection"; see *Note Function Indirection::.

   In practice, nearly all functions are given names in this way and
referred to through their names.  For example, the symbol `car' works
as a function and does what it does because the primitive subr-object
`#<subr car>' is stored in its function cell.

   We give functions names because it is convenient to refer to them by
their names in Lisp expressions.  For primitive subr-objects such as
`#<subr car>', names are the only way you can refer to them: there is
no read syntax for such objects.  For functions written in Lisp, the
name is more convenient to use in a call than an explicit lambda
expression.  Also, a function with a name can refer to itself--it can
be recursive.  Writing the function's name in its own definition is much
more convenient than making the function definition point to itself
(something that is not impossible but that has various disadvantages in
practice).

   We often identify functions with the symbols used to name them.  For
example, we often speak of "the function `car'", not distinguishing
between the symbol `car' and the primitive subr-object that is its
function definition.  For most purposes, there is no need to
distinguish.

   Even so, keep in mind that a function need not have a unique name.
While a given function object *usually* appears in the function cell of
only one symbol, this is just a matter of convenience.  It is easy to
store it in several symbols using `fset'; then each of the symbols is
equally well a name for the same function.

   A symbol used as a function name may also be used as a variable;
these two uses of a symbol are independent and do not conflict.

Defining Functions
==================

   We usually give a name to a function when it is first created.  This
is called "defining a function", and it is done with the `defun'
special form.

 - Special Form: defun NAME ARGUMENT-LIST BODY-FORMS
     `defun' is the usual way to define new Lisp functions.  It defines
     the symbol NAME as a function that looks like this:

          (lambda ARGUMENT-LIST . BODY-FORMS)

     `defun' stores this lambda expression in the function cell of
     NAME.  It returns the value NAME, but usually we ignore this value.

     As described previously (*note Lambda Expressions::.),
     ARGUMENT-LIST is a list of argument names and may include the
     keywords `&optional' and `&rest'.  Also, the first two forms in
     BODY-FORMS may be a documentation string and an interactive
     declaration.

     There is no conflict if the same symbol NAME is also used as a
     variable, since the symbol's value cell is independent of the
     function cell.  *Note Symbol Components::.

     Here are some examples:

          (defun foo () 5)
               => foo
          (foo)
               => 5
          
          (defun bar (a &optional b &rest c)
              (list a b c))
               => bar
          (bar 1 2 3 4 5)
               => (1 2 (3 4 5))
          (bar 1)
               => (1 nil nil)
          (bar)
          error--> Wrong number of arguments.
          
          (defun capitalize-backwards ()
            "Upcase the last letter of a word."
            (interactive)
            (backward-word 1)
            (forward-word 1)
            (backward-char 1)
            (capitalize-word 1))
               => capitalize-backwards

     Be careful not to redefine existing functions unintentionally.
     `defun' redefines even primitive functions such as `car' without
     any hesitation or notification.  Redefining a function already
     defined is often done deliberately, and there is no way to
     distinguish deliberate redefinition from unintentional
     redefinition.

 - Function: defalias NAME DEFINITION
     This special form defines the symbol NAME as a function, with
     definition DEFINITION (which can be any valid Lisp function).
     It's best to use this rather than `fset' when defining a function
     in a file, because `defalias' records which file defined the
     function (*note Unloading::.), while `fset' does not.

Calling Functions
=================

   Defining functions is only half the battle.  Functions don't do
anything until you "call" them, i.e., tell them to run.  Calling a
function is also known as "invocation".

   The most common way of invoking a function is by evaluating a list.
For example, evaluating the list `(concat "a" "b")' calls the function
`concat' with arguments `"a"' and `"b"'.  *Note Evaluation::, for a
description of evaluation.

   When you write a list as an expression in your program, the function
name is part of the program.  This means that you choose which function
to call, and how many arguments to give it, when you write the program.
Usually that's just what you want.  Occasionally you need to decide at
run time which function to call.  To do that, use the functions
`funcall' and `apply'.

 - Function: funcall FUNCTION &rest ARGUMENTS
     `funcall' calls FUNCTION with ARGUMENTS, and returns whatever
     FUNCTION returns.

     Since `funcall' is a function, all of its arguments, including
     FUNCTION, are evaluated before `funcall' is called.  This means
     that you can use any expression to obtain the function to be
     called.  It also means that `funcall' does not see the expressions
     you write for the ARGUMENTS, only their values.  These values are
     *not* evaluated a second time in the act of calling FUNCTION;
     `funcall' enters the normal procedure for calling a function at the
     place where the arguments have already been evaluated.

     The argument FUNCTION must be either a Lisp function or a
     primitive function.  Special forms and macros are not allowed,
     because they make sense only when given the "unevaluated" argument
     expressions.  `funcall' cannot provide these because, as we saw
     above, it never knows them in the first place.

          (setq f 'list)
               => list
          (funcall f 'x 'y 'z)
               => (x y z)
          (funcall f 'x 'y '(z))
               => (x y (z))
          (funcall 'and t nil)
          error--> Invalid function: #<subr and>

     Compare these example with the examples of `apply'.

 - Function: apply FUNCTION &rest ARGUMENTS
     `apply' calls FUNCTION with ARGUMENTS, just like `funcall' but
     with one difference: the last of ARGUMENTS is a list of arguments
     to give to FUNCTION, rather than a single argument.  We also say
     that `apply' "spreads" this list so that each individual element
     becomes an argument.

     `apply' returns the result of calling FUNCTION.  As with
     `funcall', FUNCTION must either be a Lisp function or a primitive
     function; special forms and macros do not make sense in `apply'.

          (setq f 'list)
               => list
          (apply f 'x 'y 'z)
          error--> Wrong type argument: listp, z
          (apply '+ 1 2 '(3 4))
               => 10
          (apply '+ '(1 2 3 4))
               => 10
          
          (apply 'append '((a b c) nil (x y z) nil))
               => (a b c x y z)

     For an interesting example of using `apply', see the description of
     `mapcar', in *Note Mapping Functions::.

   It is common for Lisp functions to accept functions as arguments or
find them in data structures (especially in hook variables and property
lists) and call them using `funcall' or `apply'.  Functions that accept
function arguments are often called "functionals".

   Sometimes, when you call such a function, it is useful to supply a
no-op function as the argument.  Here are two different kinds of no-op
function:

 - Function: identity ARG
     This function returns ARG and has no side effects.

 - Function: ignore &rest ARGS
     This function ignores any arguments and returns `nil'.

Mapping Functions
=================

   A "mapping function" applies a given function to each element of a
list or other collection.  Emacs Lisp has three such functions;
`mapcar' and `mapconcat', which scan a list, are described here.  For
the third mapping function, `mapatoms', see *Note Creating Symbols::.

 - Function: mapcar FUNCTION SEQUENCE
     `mapcar' applies FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE in turn, and
     returns a list of the results.

     The argument SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, or a string.  The
     result is always a list.  The length of the result is the same as
     the length of SEQUENCE.

     For example:

          (mapcar 'car '((a b) (c d) (e f)))
               => (a c e)
          (mapcar '1+ [1 2 3])
               => (2 3 4)
          (mapcar 'char-to-string "abc")
               => ("a" "b" "c")

          ;; Call each function in `my-hooks'.
          (mapcar 'funcall my-hooks)

          (defun mapcar* (f &rest args)
            "Apply FUNCTION to successive cars of all ARGS.
          Return the list of results."
            ;; If no list is exhausted,
            (if (not (memq 'nil args))
                ;; apply function to CARs.
                (cons (apply f (mapcar 'car args))
                      (apply 'mapcar* f
                             ;; Recurse for rest of elements.
                             (mapcar 'cdr args)))))

          (mapcar* 'cons '(a b c) '(1 2 3 4))
               => ((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))

 - Function: mapconcat FUNCTION SEQUENCE SEPARATOR
     `mapconcat' applies FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE: the
     results, which must be strings, are concatenated.  Between each
     pair of result strings, `mapconcat' inserts the string SEPARATOR.
     Usually SEPARATOR contains a space or comma or other suitable
     punctuation.

     The argument FUNCTION must be a function that can take one
     argument and return a string.

          (mapconcat 'symbol-name
                     '(The cat in the hat)
                     " ")
               => "The cat in the hat"

          (mapconcat (function (lambda (x) (format "%c" (1+ x))))
                     "HAL-8000"
                     "")
               => "IBM.9111"

Anonymous Functions
===================

   In Lisp, a function is a list that starts with `lambda', a byte-code
function compiled from such a list, or alternatively a primitive
subr-object; names are "extra".  Although usually functions are defined
with `defun' and given names at the same time, it is occasionally more
concise to use an explicit lambda expression--an anonymous function.
Such a list is valid wherever a function name is.

   Any method of creating such a list makes a valid function.  Even
this:

     (setq silly (append '(lambda (x)) (list (list '+ (* 3 4) 'x))))
     => (lambda (x) (+ 12 x))

This computes a list that looks like `(lambda (x) (+ 12 x))' and makes
it the value (*not* the function definition!) of `silly'.

   Here is how we might call this function:

     (funcall silly 1)
     => 13

(It does *not* work to write `(silly 1)', because this function is not
the *function definition* of `silly'.  We have not given `silly' any
function definition, just a value as a variable.)

   Most of the time, anonymous functions are constants that appear in
your program.  For example, you might want to pass one as an argument
to the function `mapcar', which applies any given function to each
element of a list.  Here we pass an anonymous function that multiplies
a number by two:

     (defun double-each (list)
       (mapcar '(lambda (x) (* 2 x)) list))
     => double-each
     (double-each '(2 11))
     => (4 22)

In such cases, we usually use the special form `function' instead of
simple quotation to quote the anonymous function.

 - Special Form: function FUNCTION-OBJECT
     This special form returns FUNCTION-OBJECT without evaluating it.
     In this, it is equivalent to `quote'.  However, it serves as a
     note to the Emacs Lisp compiler that FUNCTION-OBJECT is intended
     to be used only as a function, and therefore can safely be
     compiled.  Contrast this with `quote', in *Note Quoting::.

   Using `function' instead of `quote' makes a difference inside a
function or macro that you are going to compile.  For example:

     (defun double-each (list)
       (mapcar (function (lambda (x) (* 2 x))) list))
     => double-each
     (double-each '(2 11))
     => (4 22)

If this definition of `double-each' is compiled, the anonymous function
is compiled as well.  By contrast, in the previous definition where
ordinary `quote' is used, the argument passed to `mapcar' is the
precise list shown:

     (lambda (x) (* x 2))

The Lisp compiler cannot assume this list is a function, even though it
looks like one, since it does not know what `mapcar' does with the
list.  Perhaps `mapcar' will check that the CAR of the third element is
the symbol `*'!  The advantage of `function' is that it tells the
compiler to go ahead and compile the constant function.

   We sometimes write `function' instead of `quote' when quoting the
name of a function, but this usage is just a sort of comment.

     (function SYMBOL) == (quote SYMBOL) == 'SYMBOL

   See `documentation' in *Note Accessing Documentation::, for a
realistic example using `function' and an anonymous function.


File: elisp,  Node: Function Cells,  Next: Inline Functions,  Prev: Anonymous Functions,  Up: Functions

Accessing Function Cell Contents
================================

   The "function definition" of a symbol is the object stored in the
function cell of the symbol.  The functions described here access, test,
and set the function cell of symbols.

   See also the function `indirect-function' in *Note Function
Indirection::.

 - Function: symbol-function SYMBOL
     This returns the object in the function cell of SYMBOL.  If the
     symbol's function cell is void, a `void-function' error is
     signaled.

     This function does not check that the returned object is a
     legitimate function.

          (defun bar (n) (+ n 2))
               => bar
          (symbol-function 'bar)
               => (lambda (n) (+ n 2))
          (fset 'baz 'bar)
               => bar
          (symbol-function 'baz)
               => bar

   If you have never given a symbol any function definition, we say that
that symbol's function cell is "void".  In other words, the function
cell does not have any Lisp object in it.  If you try to call such a
symbol as a function, it signals a `void-function' error.

   Note that void is not the same as `nil' or the symbol `void'.  The
symbols `nil' and `void' are Lisp objects, and can be stored into a
function cell just as any other object can be (and they can be valid
functions if you define them in turn with `defun').  A void function
cell contains no object whatsoever.

   You can test the voidness of a symbol's function definition with
`fboundp'.  After you have given a symbol a function definition, you
can make it void once more using `fmakunbound'.

 - Function: fboundp SYMBOL
     This function returns `t' if the symbol has an object in its
     function cell, `nil' otherwise.  It does not check that the object
     is a legitimate function.

 - Function: fmakunbound SYMBOL
     This function makes SYMBOL's function cell void, so that a
     subsequent attempt to access this cell will cause a `void-function'
     error.  (See also `makunbound', in *Note Local Variables::.)

          (defun foo (x) x)
               => x
          (foo 1)
               =>1
          (fmakunbound 'foo)
               => x
          (foo 1)
          error--> Symbol's function definition is void: foo

 - Function: fset SYMBOL OBJECT
     This function stores OBJECT in the function cell of SYMBOL.  The
     result is OBJECT.  Normally OBJECT should be a function or the
     name of a function, but this is not checked.

     There are three normal uses of this function:

        * Copying one symbol's function definition to another.  (In
          other words, making an alternate name for a function.)

        * Giving a symbol a function definition that is not a list and
          therefore cannot be made with `defun'.  For example, you can
          use `fset' to give a symbol `s1' a function definition which
          is another symbol `s2'; then `s1' serves as an alias for
          whatever definition `s2' presently has.

        * In constructs for defining or altering functions.  If `defun'
          were not a primitive, it could be written in Lisp (as a
          macro) using `fset'.

     Here are examples of the first two uses:

          ;; Give `first' the same definition `car' has.
          (fset 'first (symbol-function 'car))
               => #<subr car>
          (first '(1 2 3))
               => 1
          
          ;; Make the symbol `car' the function definition of `xfirst'.
          (fset 'xfirst 'car)
               => car
          (xfirst '(1 2 3))
               => 1
          (symbol-function 'xfirst)
               => car
          (symbol-function (symbol-function 'xfirst))
               => #<subr car>
          
          ;; Define a named keyboard macro.
          (fset 'kill-two-lines "\^u2\^k")
               => "\^u2\^k"

     See also the related function `defalias', in *Note Defining
     Functions::.

   When writing a function that extends a previously defined function,
the following idiom is often used:

     (fset 'old-foo (symbol-function 'foo))
     (defun foo ()
       "Just like old-foo, except more so."
       (old-foo)
       (more-so))

This does not work properly if `foo' has been defined to autoload.  In
such a case, when `foo' calls `old-foo', Lisp attempts to define
`old-foo' by loading a file.  Since this presumably defines `foo'
rather than `old-foo', it does not produce the proper results.  The
only way to avoid this problem is to make sure the file is loaded
before moving aside the old definition of `foo'.

Inline Functions
================

   You can define an "inline function" by using `defsubst' instead of
`defun'.  An inline function works just like an ordinary function
except for one thing: when you compile a call to the function, the
function's definition is open-coded into the caller.

   Making a function inline makes explicit calls run faster.  But it
also has disadvantages.  For one thing, it reduces flexibility; if you
change the definition of the function, calls already inlined still use
the old definition until you recompile them.  Since the flexibility of
redefining functions is an important feature of Emacs, you should not
make a function inline unless its speed is really crucial.

   Another disadvantage is that making a large function inline can
increase the size of compiled code both in files and in memory.  Since
the speed advantage of inline functions is greatest for small
functions, you generally should not make large functions inline.

   It's possible to define a macro to expand into the same code that an
inline function would execute.  But the macro would have a limitation:
you can use it only explicitly--a macro cannot be called with `apply',
`mapcar' and so on.  Also, it takes some work to convert an ordinary
function into a macro.  (*Note Macros::.)  To convert it into an inline
function is very easy; simply replace `defun' with `defsubst'.  Since
each argument of an inline function is evaluated exactly once, you
needn't worry about how many times the body uses the arguments, as you
do for macros.  (*Note Argument Evaluation::.)

   Inline functions can be used and open-coded later on in the same
file, following the definition, just like macros.

   Emacs versions prior to 19 did not have inline functions.

Macros
******

   "Macros" enable you to define new control constructs and other
language features.  A macro is defined much like a function, but instead
of telling how to compute a value, it tells how to compute another Lisp
expression which will in turn compute the value.  We call this
expression the "expansion" of the macro.

   Macros can do this because they operate on the unevaluated
expressions for the arguments, not on the argument values as functions
do.  They can therefore construct an expansion containing these
argument expressions or parts of them.

   If you are using a macro to do something an ordinary function could
do, just for the sake of speed, consider using an inline function
instead.  *Note Inline Functions::.

A Simple Example of a Macro
===========================

   Suppose we would like to define a Lisp construct to increment a
variable value, much like the `++' operator in C.  We would like to
write `(inc x)' and have the effect of `(setq x (1+ x))'.  Here's a
macro definition that does the job:

     (defmacro inc (var)
        (list 'setq var (list '1+ var)))

   When this is called with `(inc x)', the argument `var' has the value
`x'--*not* the *value* of `x'.  The body of the macro uses this to
construct the expansion, which is `(setq x (1+ x))'.  Once the macro
definition returns this expansion, Lisp proceeds to evaluate it, thus
incrementing `x'.


File: elisp,  Node: Expansion,  Next: Compiling Macros,  Prev: Simple Macro,  Up: Macros

Expansion of a Macro Call
=========================

   A macro call looks just like a function call in that it is a list
which starts with the name of the macro.  The rest of the elements of
the list are the arguments of the macro.

   Evaluation of the macro call begins like evaluation of a function
call except for one crucial difference: the macro arguments are the
actual expressions appearing in the macro call.  They are not evaluated
before they are given to the macro definition.  By contrast, the
arguments of a function are results of evaluating the elements of the
function call list.

   Having obtained the arguments, Lisp invokes the macro definition just
as a function is invoked.  The argument variables of the macro are bound
to the argument values from the macro call, or to a list of them in the
case of a `&rest' argument.  And the macro body executes and returns
its value just as a function body does.

   The second crucial difference between macros and functions is that
the value returned by the macro body is not the value of the macro call.
Instead, it is an alternate expression for computing that value, also
known as the "expansion" of the macro.  The Lisp interpreter proceeds
to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the macro.

   Since the expansion is evaluated in the normal manner, it may contain
calls to other macros.  It may even be a call to the same macro, though
this is unusual.

   You can see the expansion of a given macro call by calling
`macroexpand'.

 - Function: macroexpand FORM &optional ENVIRONMENT
     This function expands FORM, if it is a macro call.  If the result
     is another macro call, it is expanded in turn, until something
     which is not a macro call results.  That is the value returned by
     `macroexpand'.  If FORM is not a macro call to begin with, it is
     returned as given.

     Note that `macroexpand' does not look at the subexpressions of
     FORM (although some macro definitions may do so).  Even if they
     are macro calls themselves, `macroexpand' does not expand them.

     The function `macroexpand' does not expand calls to inline
     functions.  Normally there is no need for that, since a call to an
     inline function is no harder to understand than a call to an
     ordinary function.

     If ENVIRONMENT is provided, it specifies an alist of macro
     definitions that shadow the currently defined macros.  Byte
     compilation uses this feature.

          (defmacro inc (var)
              (list 'setq var (list '1+ var)))
               => inc

          (macroexpand '(inc r))
               => (setq r (1+ r))

          (defmacro inc2 (var1 var2)
              (list 'progn (list 'inc var1) (list 'inc var2)))
               => inc2

          (macroexpand '(inc2 r s))
               => (progn (inc r) (inc s))  ; `inc' not expanded here.

Macros and Byte Compilation
===========================

   You might ask why we take the trouble to compute an expansion for a
macro and then evaluate the expansion.  Why not have the macro body
produce the desired results directly?  The reason has to do with
compilation.

   When a macro call appears in a Lisp program being compiled, the Lisp
compiler calls the macro definition just as the interpreter would, and
receives an expansion.  But instead of evaluating this expansion, it
compiles the expansion as if it had appeared directly in the program.
As a result, the compiled code produces the value and side effects
intended for the macro, but executes at full compiled speed.  This would
not work if the macro body computed the value and side effects
itself--they would be computed at compile time, which is not useful.

   In order for compilation of macro calls to work, the macros must be
defined in Lisp when the calls to them are compiled.  The compiler has a
special feature to help you do this: if a file being compiled contains a
`defmacro' form, the macro is defined temporarily for the rest of the
compilation of that file.  To use this feature, you must define the
macro in the same file where it is used and before its first use.

   Byte-compiling a file executes any `require' calls at top-level in
the file.  This is in case the file needs the required packages for
proper compilation.  One way to ensure that necessary macro definitions
are available during compilation is to require the file that defines
them.  *Note Features::.


File: elisp,  Node: Defining Macros,  Next: Backquote,  Prev: Compiling Macros,  Up: Macros

Defining Macros
===============

   A Lisp macro is a list whose CAR is `macro'.  Its CDR should be a
function; expansion of the macro works by applying the function (with
`apply') to the list of unevaluated argument-expressions from the macro
call.

   It is possible to use an anonymous Lisp macro just like an anonymous
function, but this is never done, because it does not make sense to pass
an anonymous macro to mapping functions such as `mapcar'.  In practice,
all Lisp macros have names, and they are usually defined with the
special form `defmacro'.

 - Special Form: defmacro NAME ARGUMENT-LIST BODY-FORMS...
     `defmacro' defines the symbol NAME as a macro that looks like this:

          (macro lambda ARGUMENT-LIST . BODY-FORMS)

     This macro object is stored in the function cell of NAME.  The
     value returned by evaluating the `defmacro' form is NAME, but
     usually we ignore this value.

     The shape and meaning of ARGUMENT-LIST is the same as in a
     function, and the keywords `&rest' and `&optional' may be used
     (*note Argument List::.).  Macros may have a documentation string,
     but any `interactive' declaration is ignored since macros cannot be
     called interactively.


File: elisp,  Node: Backquote,  Next: Problems with Macros,  Prev: Defining Macros,  Up: Macros

Backquote
=========

   Macros often need to construct large list structures from a mixture
of constants and nonconstant parts.  To make this easier, use the macro
``' (often called "backquote").

   Backquote allows you to quote a list, but selectively evaluate
elements of that list.  In the simplest case, it is identical to the
special form `quote' (*note Quoting::.).  For example, these two forms
yield identical results:

     (` (a list of (+ 2 3) elements))
          => (a list of (+ 2 3) elements)
     (quote (a list of (+ 2 3) elements))
          => (a list of (+ 2 3) elements)

   The special marker `,' inside of the argument to backquote indicates
a value that isn't constant.  Backquote evaluates the argument of `,'
and puts the value in the list structure:

     (list 'a 'list 'of (+ 2 3) 'elements)
          => (a list of 5 elements)
     (` (a list of (, (+ 2 3)) elements))
          => (a list of 5 elements)

   You can also "splice" an evaluated value into the resulting list,
using the special marker `,@'.  The elements of the spliced list become
elements at the same level as the other elements of the resulting list.
The equivalent code without using ``' is often unreadable.  Here are
some examples:

     (setq some-list '(2 3))
          => (2 3)
     (cons 1 (append some-list '(4) some-list))
          => (1 2 3 4 2 3)
     (` (1 (,@ some-list) 4 (,@ some-list)))
          => (1 2 3 4 2 3)
     
     (setq list '(hack foo bar))
          => (hack foo bar)
     (cons 'use
       (cons 'the
         (cons 'words (append (cdr list) '(as elements)))))
          => (use the words foo bar as elements)
     (` (use the words (,@ (cdr list)) as elements))
          => (use the words foo bar as elements)

   Emacs 18 had a bug that made the previous example fail.  The bug
affected `,@' followed only by constant elements.  If you are concerned
with Emacs 18 compatibility, you can work around the bug like this:

     (` (use the words (,@ (cdr list)) as elements `(,@ nil)'))

`(,@ nil)' avoids the problem by being a nonconstant element that does
not affect the result.

 - Macro: ` LIST
     This macro quotes LIST except for any sublists of the form `(,
     SUBEXP)' or `(,@ LISTEXP)'.  Backquote replaces these sublists
     with the value of SUBEXP (as a single element) or LISTEXP (by
     splicing).  Backquote copies the structure of LIST down to the
     places where variable parts are substituted.


     Common Lisp note: in Common Lisp, `,' and `,@' are implemented as
     reader macros, so they do not require parentheses.  In Emacs Lisp
     they use function call syntax because reader macros are not
     supported (for simplicity's sake).

Common Problems Using Macros
============================

   The basic facts of macro expansion have counterintuitive
consequences.  This section describes some important consequences that
can lead to trouble, and rules to follow to avoid trouble.

* Menu:

* Argument Evaluation::    The expansion should evaluate each macro arg once.
* Surprising Local Vars::  Local variable bindings in the expansion
                              require special care.
* Eval During Expansion::  Don't evaluate them; put them in the expansion.
* Repeated Expansion::     Avoid depending on how many times expansion is done.


File: elisp,  Node: Argument Evaluation,  Next: Surprising Local Vars,  Up: Problems with Macros

Evaluating Macro Arguments Repeatedly
-------------------------------------

   When defining a macro you must pay attention to the number of times
the arguments will be evaluated when the expansion is executed.  The
following macro (used to facilitate iteration) illustrates the problem.
This macro allows us to write a simple "for" loop such as one might
find in Pascal.

     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &rest body)
       "Execute a simple \"for\" loop.
     For example, (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       (list 'let (list (list var init))
             (cons 'while (cons (list '<= var final)
                                (append body (list (list 'inc var)))))))
     => for
     (for i from 1 to 3 do
        (setq square (* i i))
        (princ (format "\n%d %d" i square)))
     ==>

     (let ((i 1))
       (while (<= i 3)
         (setq square (* i i))
         (princ (format "%d      %d" i square))
         (inc i)))


     -|1       1
          -|2       4
          -|3       9
     => nil

(The arguments `from', `to', and `do' in this macro are "syntactic
sugar"; they are entirely ignored.  The idea is that you will write
noise words (such as `from', `to', and `do') in those positions in the
macro call.)

   Here's an equivalent definition simplified through use of backquote:

     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &rest body)
       "Execute a simple \"for\" loop.
     For example, (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       (` (let (((, var) (, init)))
             (while (<= (, var) (, final))
               (,@ body)
               (inc (, var))))))

   Both forms of this definition (with backquote and without) suffer
from the defect that FINAL is evaluated on every iteration.  If FINAL
is a constant, this is not a problem.  If it is a more complex form,
say `(long-complex-calculation x)', this can slow down the execution
significantly.  If FINAL has side effects, executing it more than once
is probably incorrect.

   A well-designed macro definition takes steps to avoid this problem by
producing an expansion that evaluates the argument expressions exactly
once unless repeated evaluation is part of the intended purpose of the
macro.  Here is a correct expansion for the `for' macro:

     (let ((i 1)
           (max 3))
       (while (<= i max)
         (setq square (* i i))
         (princ (format "%d      %d" i square))
         (inc i)))

   Here is a macro definition that creates this expansion:

     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &rest body)
       "Execute a simple for loop: (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       (` (let (((, var) (, init))
                (max (, final)))
            (while (<= (, var) max)
              (,@ body)
              (inc (, var))))))

   Unfortunately, this introduces another problem.  Proceed to the
following node.


File: elisp,  Node: Surprising Local Vars,  Next: Eval During Expansion,  Prev: Argument Evaluation,  Up: Problems with Macros

Local Variables in Macro Expansions
-----------------------------------

   In the previous section, the definition of `for' was fixed as
follows to make the expansion evaluate the macro arguments the proper
number of times:

     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &rest body)
       "Execute a simple for loop: (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."

     (` (let (((, var) (, init))
                (max (, final)))
            (while (<= (, var) max)
              (,@ body)
              (inc (, var))))))

   The new definition of `for' has a new problem: it introduces a local
variable named `max' which the user does not expect.  This causes
trouble in examples such as the following:

     (let ((max 0))
       (for x from 0 to 10 do
         (let ((this (frob x)))
           (if (< max this)
               (setq max this)))))

The references to `max' inside the body of the `for', which are
supposed to refer to the user's binding of `max', really access the
binding made by `for'.

   The way to correct this is to use an uninterned symbol instead of
`max' (*note Creating Symbols::.).  The uninterned symbol can be bound
and referred to just like any other symbol, but since it is created by
`for', we know that it cannot already appear in the user's program.
Since it is not interned, there is no way the user can put it into the
program later.  It will never appear anywhere except where put by
`for'.  Here is a definition of `for' that works this way:

     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &rest body)
       "Execute a simple for loop: (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       (let ((tempvar (make-symbol "max")))
         (` (let (((, var) (, init))
                  ((, tempvar) (, final)))
              (while (<= (, var) (, tempvar))
                     (,@ body)
                     (inc (, var)))))))

This creates an uninterned symbol named `max' and puts it in the
expansion instead of the usual interned symbol `max' that appears in
expressions ordinarily.


File: elisp,  Node: Eval During Expansion,  Next: Repeated Expansion,  Prev: Surprising Local Vars,  Up: Problems with Macros

Evaluating Macro Arguments in Expansion
---------------------------------------

   Another problem can happen if you evaluate any of the macro argument
expressions during the computation of the expansion, such as by calling
`eval' (*note Eval::.).  If the argument is supposed to refer to the
user's variables, you may have trouble if the user happens to use a
variable with the same name as one of the macro arguments.  Inside the
macro body, the macro argument binding is the most local binding of this
variable, so any references inside the form being evaluated do refer to
it.  Here is an example:

     (defmacro foo (a)
       (list 'setq (eval a) t))
          => foo
     (setq x 'b)
     (foo x) ==> (setq b t)
          => t                  ; and `b' has been set.
     ;; but
     (setq a 'c)
     (foo a) ==> (setq a t)
          => t                  ; but this set `a', not `c'.

   It makes a difference whether the user's variable is named `a' or
`x', because `a' conflicts with the macro argument variable `a'.

   Another reason not to call `eval' in a macro definition is that it
probably won't do what you intend in a compiled program.  The
byte-compiler runs macro definitions while compiling the program, when
the program's own computations (which you might have wished to access
with `eval') don't occur and its local variable bindings don't exist.

   The safe way to work with the run-time value of an expression is to
put the expression into the macro expansion, so that its value is
computed as part of executing the expansion.


File: elisp,  Node: Repeated Expansion,  Prev: Eval During Expansion,  Up: Problems with Macros

How Many Times is the Macro Expanded?
-------------------------------------

   Occasionally problems result from the fact that a macro call is
expanded each time it is evaluated in an interpreted function, but is
expanded only once (during compilation) for a compiled function.  If the
macro definition has side effects, they will work differently depending
on how many times the macro is expanded.

   In particular, constructing objects is a kind of side effect.  If the
macro is called once, then the objects are constructed only once.  In
other words, the same structure of objects is used each time the macro
call is executed.  In interpreted operation, the macro is reexpanded
each time, producing a fresh collection of objects each time.  Usually
this does not matter--the objects have the same contents whether they
are shared or not.  But if the surrounding program does side effects on
the objects, it makes a difference whether they are shared.  Here is an
example:

     (defmacro empty-object ()
       (list 'quote (cons nil nil)))

     (defun initialize (condition)
       (let ((object (empty-object)))
         (if condition
             (setcar object condition))
         object))

If `initialize' is interpreted, a new list `(nil)' is constructed each
time `initialize' is called.  Thus, no side effect survives between
calls.  If `initialize' is compiled, then the macro `empty-object' is
expanded during compilation, producing a single "constant" `(nil)' that
is reused and altered each time `initialize' is called.

   One way to avoid pathological cases like this is to think of
`empty-object' as a funny kind of constant, not as a memory allocation
construct.  You wouldn't use `setcar' on a constant such as `'(nil)',
so naturally you won't use it on `(empty-object)' either.

file, reads the text, evaluates each form, and then closes the file.

   The load functions evaluate all the expressions in a file just as
the `eval-current-buffer' function evaluates all the expressions in a
buffer.  The difference is that the load functions read and evaluate
the text in the file as found on disk, not the text in an Emacs buffer.

   The loaded file must contain Lisp expressions, either as source code
or as byte-compiled code.  Each form in the file is called a "top-level
form".  There is no special format for the forms in a loadable file;
any form in a file may equally well be typed directly into a buffer and
evaluated there.  (Indeed, most code is tested this way.)  Most often,
the forms are function definitions and variable definitions.

   A file containing Lisp code is often called a "library".  Thus, the
"Rmail library" is a file containing code for Rmail mode.  Similarly, a
"Lisp library directory" is a directory of files containing Lisp code.
