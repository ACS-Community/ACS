Hooks
=====

   A "hook" is a variable where you can store a function or functions
to be called on a particular occasion by an existing program.  Emacs
provides hooks for the sake of customization.  Most often, hooks are set
up in the `.emacs' file, but Lisp programs can set them also.  *Note
Standard Hooks::, for a list of standard hook variables.

   Most of the hooks in Emacs are "normal hooks".  These variables
contain lists of functions to be called with no arguments.  The reason
most hooks are normal hooks is so that you can use them in a uniform
way.  You can always tell when a hook is a normal hook, because its
name ends in `-hook'.

   The recommended way to add a hook function to a normal hook is by
calling `add-hook' (see below).  The hook functions may be any of the
valid kinds of functions that `funcall' accepts (*note What Is a
Function::.).  Most normal hook variables are initially void;
`add-hook' knows how to deal with this.

   As for abnormal hooks, those whose names end in `-function' have a
value that is a single function.  Those whose names end in `-hooks'
have a value that is a list of functions.  Any hook that is abnormal is
abnormal because a normal hook won't do the job; either the functions
are called with arguments, or their values are meaningful.  The name
shows you that the hook is abnormal and that you should look at its
documentation string to see how to use it properly.

   Most major modes run hooks as the last step of initialization.  This
makes it easy for a user to customize the behavior of the mode, by
overriding the local variable assignments already made by the mode.  But
hooks are used in other contexts too.  For example, the hook
`suspend-hook' runs just before Emacs suspends itself (*note Suspending
Emacs::.).

   Here's an expression you can put in your `.emacs' file to turn on
Auto Fill mode when in Lisp Interaction mode:

     (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

   The next example shows how to use a hook to customize the way Emacs
formats C code.  (People often have strong personal preferences for one
format or another.)  Here the hook function is an anonymous lambda
expression.

     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
       (function (lambda ()
                   (setq c-indent-level 4
                         c-argdecl-indent 0
                         c-label-offset -4
                         c-continued-statement-indent 0
                         c-brace-offset 0
                         comment-column 40))))
     
     (setq c++-mode-hook c-mode-hook)

   Finally, here is an example of how to use the Text mode hook to
provide a customized mode line for buffers in Text mode, displaying the
default directory in addition to the standard components of the mode
line.  (This may cause the mode line to run out of space if you have
very long file names or display the time and load.)

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
       (function (lambda ()
                   (setq mode-line-format
                         '(mode-line-modified
                           "Emacs: %14b"
                           "  "
                           default-directory
                           " "
                           global-mode-string
                           "%[("
                           mode-name
                           minor-mode-alist
                           "%n"
                           mode-line-process
                           ") %]---"
                           (-3 . "%p")
                           "-%-")))))

   At the appropriate time, Emacs uses the `run-hooks' function to run
particular hooks.  This function calls the hook functions you have
added with `add-hooks'.

 - Function: run-hooks &rest HOOKVAR
     This function takes one or more hook variable names as arguments,
     and runs each hook in turn.  Each HOOKVAR argument should be a
     symbol that is a hook variable.  These arguments are processed in
     the order specified.

     If a hook variable has a non-`nil' value, that value may be a
     function or a list of functions.  If the value is a function
     (either a lambda expression or a symbol with a function
     definition), it is called.  If it is a list, the elements are
     called, in order.  The hook functions are called with no arguments.

     For example, here's how `emacs-lisp-hooks' runs its mode hook:

          (run-hooks 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook)

 - Function: add-hook HOOK FUNCTION &optional APPEND
     This function is the handy way to add function FUNCTION to hook
     variable HOOK.  The argument FUNCTION may be any valid Lisp
     function with the proper number of arguments.  For example,

          (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'my-text-hook-function)

     adds `my-text-hook-function' to the hook called `text-mode-hook'.

     You can use `add-hook' for abnormal hooks as well as for normal
     hooks.

     It is best to design your hook functions so that the order in
     which they are executed does not matter.  Any dependence on the
     order is "asking for trouble."  However, the order is predictable:
     normally, FUNCTION goes at the front of the hook list, so it will
     be executed first (barring another `add-hook' call).

     If the optional argument APPEND is non-`nil', the new hook
     function goes at the end of the hook list and will be executed
     last.

 - Function: remove-hook HOOK FUNCTION
     This function removes FUNCTION from the hook variable HOOK.

Documentation
*************

   GNU Emacs Lisp has convenient on-line help facilities, most of which
derive their information from the documentation strings associated with
functions and variables.  This chapter describes how to write good
documentation strings for your Lisp programs, as well as how to write
programs to access documentation.

   Note that the documentation strings for Emacs are not the same thing
as the Emacs manual.  Manuals have their own source files, written in
the Texinfo language; documentation strings are specified in the
definitions of the functions and variables they apply to.  A collection
of documentation strings is not sufficient as a manual because a good
manual is not organized in that fashion; it is organized in terms of
topics of discussion.

* Menu:

* Documentation Basics::      Good style for doc strings.
                                Where to put them.  How Emacs stores them.

Documentation Basics
====================

   A documentation string is written using the Lisp syntax for strings,
with double-quote characters surrounding the text of the string.  This
is because it really is a Lisp string object.  The string serves as
documentation when it is written in the proper place in the definition
of a function or variable.  In a function definition, the documentation
string follows the argument list.  In a variable definition, the
documentation string follows the initial value of the variable.

   When you write a documentation string, make the first line a complete
sentence (or two complete sentences) since some commands, such as
`apropos', show only the first line of a multi-line documentation
string.  Also, you should not indent the second line of a documentation
string, if you have one, because that looks odd when you use `C-h f'
(`describe-function') or `C-h v' (`describe-variable').  *Note
Documentation Tips::.

   Documentation strings may contain several special substrings, which
stand for key bindings to be looked up in the current keymaps when the
documentation is displayed.  This allows documentation strings to refer
to the keys for related commands and be accurate even when a user
rearranges the key bindings.  (*Note Accessing Documentation::.)

   Within the Lisp world, a documentation string is kept with the
function or variable that it describes:

   * The documentation for a function is stored in the function
     definition itself (*note Lambda Expressions::.).  The function
     `documentation' knows how to extract it.

   * The documentation for a variable is stored in the variable's
     property list under the property name `variable-documentation'.
     The function `documentation-property' knows how to extract it.

   To save space, the documentation for preloaded functions and
variables (including primitive functions and autoloaded functions) is
stored in the file `emacs/etc/DOC-VERSION'.  The data structure inside
Emacs has an integer offset into the file, where the documentation
string ought to be.  The functions `documentation' and
`documentation-property' read the documentation from the file
`emacs/etc/DOC-VERSION' when they notice the integer there; this is
transparent to the user.  Keeping the documentation strings out of the
Emacs core image saves a significant amount of space.  *Note Building
Emacs::.

   For information on the uses of documentation strings, see *Note
Help: (emacs)Help.

   The `emacs/lib-src' directory contains two utilities that you can
use to print nice-looking hardcopy for the file
`emacs/etc/DOC-VERSION'.  These are `sorted-doc.c' and `digest-doc.c'.

Access to Documentation Strings
===============================

 - Function: documentation-property SYMBOL PROPERTY &optional VERBATIM
     This function returns the documentation string that is recorded
     SYMBOL's property list under property PROPERTY.  It retrieves the
     text from the file `emacs/etc/DOC-VERSION' if necessary, and runs
     `substitute-command-keys' to substitute actual key bindings.
     (This substitution is not done if VERBATIM is non-`nil'; the
     VERBATIM argument exists only as of Emacs 19.)

          (documentation-property 'command-line-processed
             'variable-documentation)
               => "t once command line has been processed"

          (symbol-plist 'command-line-processed)
               => (variable-documentation 188902)

 - Function: documentation FUNCTION &optional VERBATIM
     This function returns the documentation string of FUNCTION.  This
     function will access the documentation string if it is stored in
     the `emacs/etc/DOC-VERSION' file.

     In addition, `documentation' runs `substitute-command-keys' on the
     resulting string, so the value contains the actual (current) key
     bindings.  (This is not done if VERBATIM is non-`nil'; the
     VERBATIM argument exists only as of Emacs 19.)

     The function `documentation' signals a `void-function' error if
     FUNCTION has no function definition.  However, it is ok if the
     function definition has no documentation string.  In that case,
     `documentation' returns `nil'.

   Here is an example of using the two functions, `documentation' and
`documentation-property', to display the documentation strings for
several symbols in a `*Help*' buffer.

     (defun describe-symbols (pattern)
       "Describe the Emacs Lisp symbols matching PATTERN.
     All symbols that have PATTERN in their name are described
     in the `*Help*' buffer."
       (interactive "sDescribe symbols matching: ")
       (let ((describe-func
              (function
               (lambda (s)

     ;; Print description of symbol.
                 (if (fboundp s)             ; It is a function.
                     (princ
                      (format "%s\t%s\n%s\n\n" s
                        (if (commandp s)
                            (let ((keys (where-is-internal s)))
                              (if keys
                                  (concat
                                   "Keys: "
                                   (mapconcat 'key-description
                                              keys " "))
                                "Keys: none"))
                          "Function")

     (or (documentation s)
                            "not documented"))))
     
                 (if (boundp s)              ; It is a variable.

     (princ
                      (format "%s\t%s\n%s\n\n" s
                        (if (user-variable-p s)
                            "Option " "Variable")

     (or (documentation-property
                              s 'variable-documentation)
                            "not documented")))))))
             sym-list)

     ;; Build a list of symbols that match pattern.
         (mapatoms (function
                    (lambda (sym)
                      (if (string-match pattern (symbol-name sym))
                          (setq sym-list (cons sym sym-list))))))

     ;; Display the data.
         (with-output-to-temp-buffer "*Help*"
           (mapcar describe-func (sort sym-list 'string<))
           (print-help-return-message))))

   The `describe-symbols' function works like `apropos', but provides
more information.

     (describe-symbols "goal")
     
     ---------- Buffer: *Help* ----------
     goal-column     Option
     *Semipermanent goal column for vertical motion, as set by C-x C-n, or nil.

     set-goal-column Command: C-x C-n
     Set the current horizontal position as a goal for C-n and C-p.

     Those commands will move to this position in the line moved to
     rather than trying to keep the same horizontal position.
     With a non-nil argument, clears out the goal column
     so that C-n and C-p resume vertical motion.
     The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column'.

     temporary-goal-column   Variable
     Current goal column for vertical motion.
     It is the column where point was
     at the start of current run of vertical motion commands.
     When the `track-eol' feature is doing its job, the value is 9999.
     ---------- Buffer: *Help* ----------

 - Function: Snarf-documentation FILENAME
     This function is used only during Emacs initialization, just before
     the runnable Emacs is dumped.  It finds the file offsets of the
     documentation strings stored in the file FILENAME, and records
     them in the in-core function definitions and variable property
     lists in place of the actual strings.  *Note Building Emacs::.

     Emacs finds the file FILENAME in the `emacs/etc' directory.  When
     the dumped Emacs is later executed, the same file is found in the
     directory `doc-directory'.  Usually FILENAME is `"DOC-VERSION"'.

 - Variable: doc-directory
     This variable holds the name of the directory which should contion
     the file `"DOC-VERSION"' that contains documentation strings for
     built-in and preloaded functions and variables.

     In most cases, this is the same as `data-directory'.  They may be
     different when you run Emacs from the directory where you built it,
     without actually installing it.  See `data-directory' in *Note
     Help Functions::.

     In older Emacs versions, `exec-directory' was used for this.

Substituting Key Bindings in Documentation
==========================================

   When documentation strings refer to key sequences, they should use
the current, actual key bindings.  They can do so using certain special
text sequences described below.  Accessing documentation strings in the
usual way substitutes current key binding information for these special
sequences.  This works by calling `substitute-command-keys'.  You can
also call that function yourself.

   Here is a list of the special sequences and what they mean:

`\[COMMAND]'
     stands for a key sequence that will invoke COMMAND, or `M-x
     COMMAND' if COMMAND has no key bindings.

`\{MAPVAR}'
     stands for a summary of the value of MAPVAR, which should be a
     keymap.  The summary is made by `describe-bindings'.

`\<MAPVAR>'
     stands for no text itself.  It is used for a side effect: it
     specifies MAPVAR as the keymap for any following `\[COMMAND]'
     sequences in this documentation string.

   *Please note:* Each `\' must be doubled when written in a string in
Emacs Lisp.

 - Function: substitute-command-keys STRING
     This function scans STRING for the above special sequences and
     replaces them by what they stand for, returning the result as a
     string.  This permits display of documentation that refers
     accurately to the user's own customized key bindings.

   Here are examples of the special sequences:

     (substitute-command-keys
        "To abort recursive edit, type: \\[abort-recursive-edit]")
     => "To abort recursive edit, type: C-]"

     (substitute-command-keys
        "The keys that are defined for the minibuffer here are:
       \\{minibuffer-local-must-match-map}")
     => "The keys that are defined for the minibuffer here are:
     
     ?               minibuffer-completion-help
     SPC             minibuffer-complete-word
     TAB             minibuffer-complete
     LFD             minibuffer-complete-and-exit
     RET             minibuffer-complete-and-exit
     C-g             abort-recursive-edit
     "
     (substitute-command-keys
        "To abort a recursive edit from the minibuffer, type\
     \\<minibuffer-local-must-match-map>\\[abort-recursive-edit].")
     => "To abort a recursive edit from the minibuffer, type C-g."

Describing Characters for Help Messages
=======================================

   These functions convert events, key sequences or characters to
textual descriptions.  These descriptions are useful for including
arbitrary text characters or key sequences in messages, because they
convert non-printing and whitespace characters to sequences of printing
characters.  The description of a non-whitespace printing character is
the character itself.

 - Function: key-description SEQUENCE
     This function returns a string containing the Emacs standard
     notation for the input events in SEQUENCE.  The argument SEQUENCE
     may be a string, vector or list.  *Note Input Events::, for more
     information about valid events.  See also the examples for
     `single-key-description', below.

 - Function: single-key-description EVENT
     This function returns a string describing EVENT in the standard
     Emacs notation for keyboard input.  A normal printing character
     appears as itself, but a control character turns into a string
     starting with `C-', a meta character turns into a string starting
     with `M-', and space, linefeed, etc. appear as `SPC', `LFD', etc.
     A function key symbol appears as itself.  An event that is a list
     appears as the name of the symbol in the CAR of the list.

          (single-key-description ?\C-x)
               => "C-x"

          (key-description "\C-x \M-y \n \t \r \f123")
               => "C-x SPC M-y SPC LFD SPC TAB SPC RET SPC C-l 1 2 3"

          (single-key-description 'C-mouse-1)
               => "C-mouse-1"

 - Function: text-char-description CHARACTER
     This function returns a string describing CHARACTER in the
     standard Emacs notation for characters that appear in text--like
     `single-key-description', except that control characters are
     represented with a leading caret (which is how control characters
     in Emacs buffers are usually displayed).

          (text-char-description ?\C-c)
               => "^C"

          (text-char-description ?\M-m)
               => "M-m"

          (text-char-description ?\C-\M-m)
               => "M-^M"

Help Functions
==============

   Emacs provides a variety of on-line help functions, all accessible to
the user as subcommands of the prefix `C-h'.  For more information
about them, see *Note Help: (emacs)Help.  Here we describe some
program-level interfaces to the same information.

 - Command: apropos REGEXP &optional DO-ALL PREDICATE
     This function finds all symbols whose names contain a match for the
     regular expression REGEXP, and returns a list of them (*note
     Regular Expressions::.).  It also displays the symbols in a buffer
     named `*Help*', each with a one-line description.

     If DO-ALL is non-`nil', then `apropos' also shows key bindings for
     the functions that are found.

     If PREDICATE is non-`nil', it should be a function to be called on
     each symbol that has matched REGEXP.  Only symbols for which
     PREDICATE returns a non-`nil' value are listed or displayed.

     In the first of the following examples, `apropos' finds all the
     symbols with names containing `exec'.  In the second example, it
     finds and returns only those symbols that are also commands.  (We
     don't show the output that results in the `*Help*' buffer.)

          (apropos "exec")
               => (Buffer-menu-execute command-execute exec-directory
              exec-path execute-extended-command execute-kbd-macro
              executing-kbd-macro executing-macro)

          (apropos "exec" nil 'commandp)
               => (Buffer-menu-execute execute-extended-command)

     The command `C-h a' (`command-apropos') calls `apropos', but
     specifies a PREDICATE to restrict the output to symbols that are
     commands.  The call to `apropos' looks like this:

          (apropos string t 'commandp)

 - Command: super-apropos REGEXP &optional DO-ALL
     This function differs from `apropos' in that it searches
     documentation strings as well as symbol names for matches for
     REGEXP.  By default, it searches the documentation strings only
     for preloaded functions and variables.  If DO-ALL is non-`nil', it
     scans the names and documentation strings of all functions and
     variables.

 - Variable: help-map
     The value of this variable is a local keymap for characters
     following the Help key, `C-h'.

 - Prefix Command: help-command
     This symbol is not a function; its function definition is actually
     the keymap known as `help-map'.  It is defined in `help.el' as
     follows:

          (define-key global-map "\C-h" 'help-command)
          (fset 'help-command help-map)

 - Function: print-help-return-message &optional FUNCTION
     This function builds a string that explains how to restore the
     previous state of the windows after a help command.  After
     building the message, it applies FUNCTION to it if FUNCTION is
     non-`nil'.  Otherwise it calls `message' to display it in the echo
     area.

     This function expects to be called inside a
     `with-output-to-temp-buffer' special form, and expects
     `standard-output' to have the value bound by that special form.
     For an example of its use, see the long example in *Note Accessing
     Documentation::.

 - Variable: help-char
     The value of this variable is the help character--the character
     that Emacs recognizes as meaning Help.  By default, it is 8, which
     is `C-h'.  When Emacs reads this character, if `help-form' is
     non-`nil' Lisp expression, it evaluates that expression, and
     displays the result in a window if it is a string.

     Usually the value of `help-form''s value is `nil'.  Then the help
     character has no special meaning at the level of command input, and
     it becomes part of a key sequence in the normal way.  The standard
     key binding of `C-h' is a prefix key for several general-purpose
     help features.

     The help character is special after prefix keys, too.  If it has no
     binding as a subcommand of the prefix key, it runs
     `describe-prefix-bindings', which displays a list of all the
     subcommands of the prefix key.

 - Variable: help-form
     If this variable is non-`nil', its value is a form to evaluate
     whenever the character `help-char' is read.  If evaluating the form
     produces a string, that string is displayed.

     A command that calls `read-event' or `read-char' probably should
     bind `help-form' to a non-`nil' expression while it does input.
     (The exception is when `C-h' is meaningful input.) Evaluating this
     expression should result in a string that explains what the input
     is for and how to enter it properly.

     Entry to the minibuffer binds this variable to the value of
     `minibuffer-help-form' (*note Minibuffer Misc::.).

 - Variable: prefix-help-command
     This variable holds a function to print help for a prefix
     character.  The function is called when the user types a prefix
     key followed by the help character, and the help character has no
     binding after that prefix.  The variable's default value is
     `describe-prefix-bindings'.

 - Function: describe-prefix-bindings
     This function calls `describe-bindings' to display a list of all
     the subcommands of the prefix key of the most recent key sequence.
     The prefix described consists of all but the last event of that
     key sequence.  (The last event is, presumably, the help character.)

   The following two functions are found in the library `helper'.  They
are for modes that want to provide help without relinquishing control,
such as the "electric" modes.  You must load that library with
`(require 'helper)' in order to use them.  Their names begin with
`Helper' to distinguish them from the ordinary help functions.

 - Command: Helper-describe-bindings
     This command pops up a window displaying a help buffer containing a
     listing of all of the key bindings from both the local and global
     keymaps.  It works by calling `describe-bindings'.

 - Command: Helper-help
     This command provides help for the current mode.  It prompts the
     user in the minibuffer with the message `Help (Type ? for further
     options)', and then provides assistance in finding out what the key
     bindings are, and what the mode is intended for.  It returns `nil'.

     This can be customized by changing the map `Helper-help-map'.

 - Variable: data-directory
     This variable holds the name of the directory in which Emacs finds
     certain documentation and text files that come with Emacs.  In
     older Emacs versions, `exec-directory' was used for this.

 - Macro: make-help-screen FNAME HELP-LINE HELP-TEXT HELP-MAP
     This macro defines a help command named FNAME that acts like a
     prefix key that shows a list of the subcommands it offers.

     When invoked, FNAME displays HELP-TEXT in a window, then reads and
     executes a key sequence according to HELP-MAP.  The string
     HELP-TEXT should describe the bindings available in HELP-MAP.

     The command FNAME is defined to handle a few events itself, by
     scrolling the display of HELP-TEXT.  When FNAME reads one of those
     special events, it does the scrolling and then reads another
     event.  When it reads an event that is not one of those few, and
     which has a binding in HELP-MAP, it executes that key's binding and
     then returns.

     The argument HELP-LINE should be a single-line summary of the
     alternatives in HELP-MAP.  In the current version of Emacs, this
     argument is used only if you set the option `three-step-help' to
     `t'.

 - User Option: three-step-help
     If this variable is non-`nil', commands defined with
     `make-help-screen' display their HELP-LINE strings in the echo
     area at first, and display the longer HELP-TEXT strings only if
     the user types the help character again.

Files
*****

   In Emacs, you can find, create, view, save, and otherwise work with
files and file directories.  This chapter describes most of the
file-related functions of Emacs Lisp, but a few others are described in
*Note Buffers::, and those related to backups and auto-saving are
described in *Note Backups and Auto-Saving::.

   Many of the file functions take one or more arguments that are file
names.  A file name is actually a string.  Most of these functions
expand file name arguments using `expand-file-name', so that `~' is
handled correctly, as are relative file names (including `../').  These
functions don't recognize environment variable substitutions such as
`$HOME'.  *Note File Name Expansion::.

Visiting Files
==============

   Visiting a file means reading a file into a buffer.  Once this is
done, we say that the buffer is "visiting" that file, and call the file
"the visited file" of the buffer.

   A file and a buffer are two different things.  A file is information
recorded permanently in the computer (unless you delete it).  A buffer,
on the other hand, is information inside of Emacs that will vanish at
the end of the editing session (or when you kill the buffer).  Usually,
a buffer contains information that you have copied from a file; then we
say the buffer is visiting that file.  The copy in the buffer is what
you modify with editing commands.  Such changes to the buffer do not
change the file; therefore, to make the changes permanent, you must
"save" the buffer, which means copying the altered buffer contents back
into the file.

   In spite of the distinction between files and buffers, people often
refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice-versa.  Indeed, we say,
"I am editing a file," rather than, "I am editing a buffer that I will
soon save as a file of the same name."  Humans do not usually need to
make the distinction explicit.  When dealing with a computer program,
however, it is good to keep the distinction in mind.

Functions for Visiting Files
----------------------------

   This section describes the functions normally used to visit files.
For historical reasons, these functions have names starting with
`find-' rather than `visit-'.  *Note Buffer File Name::, for functions
and variables that access the visited file name of a buffer or that
find an existing buffer by its visited file name.

 - Command: find-file FILENAME
     This command selects a buffer visiting the file FILENAME, using an
     existing buffer if there is one, and otherwise creating a new
     buffer and reading the file into it.  It also returns that buffer.

     The body of the `find-file' function is very simple and looks like
     this:

          (switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect filename))

     (See `switch-to-buffer' in *Note Displaying Buffers::.)

     When `find-file' is called interactively, it prompts for FILENAME
     in the minibuffer.

 - Function: find-file-noselect FILENAME
     This function is the guts of all the file-visiting functions.  It
     finds or creates a buffer visiting the file FILENAME, and returns
     it.  It uses an existing buffer if there is one, and otherwise
     creates a new buffer and reads the file into it.  You may make the
     buffer current or display it in a window if you wish, but this
     function does not do so.

     When `find-file-noselect' uses an existing buffer, it first
     verifies that the file has not changed since it was last visited or
     saved in that buffer.  If the file has changed, then this function
     asks the user whether to reread the changed file.  If the user says
     `yes', any changes previously made in the buffer are lost.

     If `find-file-noselect' needs to create a buffer, and there is no
     file named FILENAME, it displays the message `New file' in the
     echo area, and leaves the buffer empty.

     The `find-file-noselect' function calls `after-find-file' after
     reading the file (*note Subroutines of Visiting::.).  That function
     sets the buffer major mode, parses local variables, warns the user
     if there exists an auto-save file more recent than the file just
     visited, and finishes by running the functions in
     `find-file-hooks'.

     The `find-file-noselect' function returns the buffer that is
     visiting the file FILENAME.

          (find-file-noselect "/etc/fstab")
               => #<buffer fstab>

 - Command: find-alternate-file FILENAME
     This command selects a buffer visiting the file FILENAME, then
     kills the buffer that was previously displayed in the selected
     window.  It is useful if you have visited the wrong file by
     mistake, so that you can get rid of the buffer that you did not
     want to create, at the same time as you visit the file you
     intended.

     When this command is called interactively, it prompts for FILENAME.

 - Command: find-file-other-window FILENAME
     This command selects a buffer visiting the file FILENAME, but does
     so in a window other than the selected window.  It may use another
     existing window or split a window; see *Note Displaying Buffers::.

     When this command is called interactively, it prompts for FILENAME.

 - Command: find-file-read-only FILENAME
     This command selects a buffer visiting the file FILENAME, like
     `find-file', but it marks the buffer as read-only.  *Note Read
     Only Buffers::, for related functions and variables.

     When this command is called interactively, it prompts for FILENAME.

 - Command: view-file FILENAME
     This command visits FILENAME in View mode, returning to the
     previous buffer when done.  View mode is a mode that allows you to
     skim rapidly through the file but does not let you modify it.
     Entering View mode runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.  *Note
     Hooks::.

     When `view-file' is called interactively, it prompts for FILENAME.

 - Variable: find-file-hooks
     The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called
     after a file is visited.  The file's local-variables specification
     (if any) will have been processed before the hooks are run.  The
     buffer visiting the file is current when the hook functions are
     run.

     This variable works just like a normal hook, but we think that
     renaming it would not be advisable.

 - Variable: find-file-not-found-hooks
     The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called when
     `find-file' or `find-file-noselect' is passed a nonexistent file
     name.  `find-file-noselect' calls these functions as soon as it
     detects a nonexistent file.  It calls them in the order of the
     list, until one of them returns non-`nil'.  `buffer-file-name' is
     already set up.

     This is not a normal hook because the values of the functions are
     used and they may not all be called.


File: elisp,  Node: Subroutines of Visiting,  Prev: Visiting Functions,  Up: Visiting Files

Subroutines of Visiting
-----------------------

   The `find-file-noselect' function uses the `create-file-buffer' and
`after-find-file' functions as subroutines.  Sometimes it is useful to
call them directly.

 - Function: create-file-buffer FILENAME
     This function creates a suitably named buffer for visiting
     FILENAME, and returns it.  It uses FILENAME (sans directory) as
     the name if that name is free; otherwise, it appends a string such
     as `<2>' to get an unused name.  See also *Note Creating Buffers::.

     *Please note:* `create-file-buffer' does *not* associate the new
     buffer with a file and does not select the buffer.

          (create-file-buffer "foo")
               => #<buffer foo>
          (create-file-buffer "foo")
               => #<buffer foo<2>>
          (create-file-buffer "foo")
               => #<buffer foo<3>>

     This function is used by `find-file-noselect'.  It uses
     `generate-new-buffer' (*note Creating Buffers::.).

 - Function: after-find-file &optional ERROR WARN
     This function sets the buffer major mode, and parses local
     variables (*note Auto Major Mode::.).  It is called by
     `find-file-noselect' and by the default revert function (*note
     Reverting::.).

     If reading the file got an error because the file does not exist,
     but its directory does exist, the caller should pass a non-`nil'
     value for ERROR.  In that case, `after-find-file' issues a warning:
     `(New File)'.  For more serious errors, the caller should usually
     not call `after-find-file'.

     If WARN is non-`nil', then this function issues a warning if an
     auto-save file exists and is more recent than the visited file.

     The last thing `after-find-file' does is call all the functions in
     `find-file-hooks'.

Saving Buffers
==============

   When you edit a file in Emacs, you are actually working on a buffer
that is visiting that file--that is, the contents of the file are
copied into the buffer and the copy is what you edit.  Changes to the
buffer do not change the file until you "save" the buffer, which means
copying the contents of the buffer into the file.

 - Command: save-buffer &optional BACKUP-OPTION
     This function saves the contents of the current buffer in its
     visited file if the buffer has been modified since it was last
     visited or saved.  Otherwise it does nothing.

     `save-buffer' is responsible for making backup files.  Normally,
     BACKUP-OPTION is `nil', and `save-buffer' makes a backup file only
     if this is the first save since visiting the file.  Other values
     for BACKUP-OPTION request the making of backup files in other
     circumstances:

        * With an argument of 4 or 64, reflecting 1 or 3 `C-u''s, the
          `save-buffer' function marks this version of the file to be
          backed up when the buffer is next saved.

        * With an argument of 16 or 64, reflecting 2 or 3 `C-u''s, the
          `save-buffer' function unconditionally backs up the previous
          version of the file before saving it.

 - Command: save-some-buffers &optional SAVE-SILENTLY-P EXITING
     This command saves some modified file-visiting buffers.  Normally
     it asks the user about each buffer.  But if SAVE-SILENTLY-P is
     non-`nil', it saves all the file-visiting buffers without querying
     the user.

     The optional EXITING argument, if non-`nil', requests this
     function to offer also to save certain other buffers that are not
     visiting files.  These are buffers that have a non-`nil' local
     value of `buffer-offer-save'.  (A user who says yes to saving one
     of these is asked to specify a file name to use.)  The
     `save-buffers-kill-emacs' function passes a non-`nil' value for
     this argument.

 - Variable: buffer-offer-save
     When this variable is non-`nil' in a buffer, Emacs offers to save
     the buffer on exit even if the buffer is not visiting a file.  The
     variable is automatically local in all buffers.  Normally, Mail
     mode (used for editing outgoing mail) sets this to `t'.

 - Command: write-file FILENAME
     This function writes the current buffer into file FILENAME, makes
     the buffer visit that file, and marks it not modified.  Then it
     renames the buffer based on FILENAME, appending a string like `<2>'
     if necessary to make a unique buffer name.  It does most of this
     work by calling `set-visited-file-name' and `save-buffer'.

 - Variable: write-file-hooks
     The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called
     before writing out a buffer to its visited file.  If one of them
     returns non-`nil', the file is considered already written and the
     rest of the functions are not called, nor is the usual code for
     writing the file executed.

     If a function in `write-file-hooks' returns non-`nil', it is
     responsible for making a backup file (if that is appropriate).  To
     do so, execute the following code:

          (or buffer-backed-up (backup-buffer))

     You might wish to save the file modes value returned by
     `backup-buffer' and use that to set the mode bits of the file that
     you write.  This is what `save-buffer' normally does.

     Even though this is not a normal hook, you can use `add-hook' and
     `remove-hook' to manipulate the list.  *Note Hooks::.

 - Variable: local-write-file-hooks
     This works just like `write-file-hooks', but it is intended to be
     made local to particular buffers.  It's not a good idea to make
     `write-file-hooks' local to a buffer--use this variable instead.

     The variable is marked as a permanent local, so that changing the
     major mode does not alter a buffer-local value.  This is
     convenient for packages that read "file" contents in special ways,
     and set up hooks to save the data in a corresponding way.

 - Variable: write-contents-hooks
     This works just like `write-file-hooks', but it is intended for
     hooks that pertain to the contents of the file, as opposed to
     hooks that pertain to where the file came from.  Typically major
     mode commands make buffer-local bindings for this variable.

 - Variable: after-save-hook
     This normal hook runs after a buffer has been saved in its visited
     file.

 - Variable: file-precious-flag
     If this variable is non-`nil', then `save-buffer' protects against
     I/O errors while saving by writing the new file to a temporary
     name instead of the name it is supposed to have, and then renaming
     it to the intended name after it is clear there are no errors.
     This procedure prevents problems such as a lack of disk space from
     resulting in an invalid file.

     (This feature worked differently in older Emacs versions.)

     Some modes set this non-`nil' locally in particular buffers.

 - User Option: require-final-newline
     This variable determines whether files may be written out that do
     *not* end with a newline.  If the value of the variable is `t',
     then `save-buffer' silently adds a newline at the end of the file
     whenever the buffer being saved does not already end in one.  If
     the value of the variable is non-`nil', but not `t', then
     `save-buffer' asks the user whether to add a newline each time the
     case arises.

     If the value of the variable is `nil', then `save-buffer' doesn't
     add newlines at all.  `nil' is the default value, but a few major
     modes set it to `t' in particular buffers.


File: elisp,  Node: Reading from Files,  Next: Writing to Files,  Prev: Saving Buffers,  Up: Files

Reading from Files
==================

   You can copy a file from the disk and insert it into a buffer using
the `insert-file-contents' function.  Don't use the user-level command
`insert-file' in a Lisp program, as that sets the mark.

 - Function: insert-file-contents FILENAME &optional VISIT BEG END
          REPLACE
     This function inserts the contents of file FILENAME into the
     current buffer after point. It returns a list of the absolute file
     name and the length of the data inserted.  An error is signaled if
     FILENAME is not the name of a file that can be read.

     To set up saved text properties, `insert-file-contents' calls the
     functions in the list `after-insert-file-functions'.  For more
     information, see *Note Saving Properties::.

     If VISIT is non-`nil', this function additionally marks the buffer
     as unmodified and sets up various fields in the buffer so that it
     is visiting the file FILENAME: these include the buffer's visited
     file name and its last save file modtime.  This feature is used by
     `find-file-noselect' and you probably should not use it yourself.

     If BEG and END are non-`nil', they should be integers specifying
     the portion of the file to insert.  In this case, VISIT must be
     `nil'.  For example,

          (insert-file-contents filename nil 0 500)

     inserts the first 500 characters of a file.

     If the argument REPLACE is non-`nil', it means to replace the
     contents of the buffer (actually, just the accessible portion)
     with the contents of the file.  This is better than simply
     deleting the buffer contents and inserting the whole file, because
     (1) it preserves some marker positions and (2) it puts less data
     in the undo list.

   If you want to pass a file name to another process so that another
program can read the file, use the function `file-local-copy'; see
*Note Magic File Names::.


File: elisp,  Node: Writing to Files,  Next: File Locks,  Prev: Reading from Files,  Up: Files

Writing to Files
================

   You can write the contents of a buffer, or part of a buffer, directly
to a file on disk using the `append-to-file' and `write-region'
functions.  Don't use these functions to write to files that are being
visited; that could cause confusion in the mechanisms for visiting.

 - Command: append-to-file START END FILENAME
     This function appends the contents of the region delimited by
     START and END in the current buffer to the end of file FILENAME.
     If that file does not exist, it is created.  This function returns
     `nil'.

     An error is signaled if FILENAME specifies a nonwritable file, or
     a nonexistent file in a directory where files cannot be created.

 - Command: write-region START END FILENAME &optional APPEND VISIT
     This function writes the region delimited by START and END in the
     current buffer into the file specified by FILENAME.

     If START is a string, then `write-region' writes or appends that
     string, rather than text from the buffer.

     If APPEND is non-`nil', then the specified text is appended to the
     existing file contents (if any).

     If VISIT is `t', then Emacs establishes an association between the
     buffer and the file: the buffer is then visiting that file.  It
     also sets the last file modification time for the current buffer to
     FILENAME's modtime, and marks the buffer as not modified.  This
     feature is used by `save-buffer', but you probably should not use
     it yourself.

     If VISIT is a string, it specifies the file name to visit.  This
     way, you can write the data to one file (FILENAME) while recording
     the buffer as visiting another file (VISIT).  The argument VISIT
     is used in the echo area message and also for file locking; VISIT
     is stored in `buffer-file-name'.  This feature is used to
     implement `file-precious-flag'; don't use it yourself unless you
     really know what you're doing.

     To output information about text properties, `write-region' calls
     the functions in the list `write-region-annotation-functions'.  For
     more information, see *Note Saving Properties::.

     Normally, `write-region' displays a message `Wrote file FILENAME'
     in the echo area.  If VISIT is neither `t' nor `nil' nor a string,
