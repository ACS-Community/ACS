Trace Buffer
------------

   Edebug can record an execution trace, storing it in a buffer named
`*edebug-trace*'.  This is a log of function calls and returns, showing
the function names and their arguments and values.  To enable trace
recording, set `edebug-trace' to a non-`nil' value.

   Making a trace buffer is not the same thing as using trace execution
mode (*note Edebug Execution Modes::.).

   When trace recording is enabled, each function entry and exit adds
lines to the trace buffer.  A function entry record looks like `::::{'
followed by the function name and argument values.  A function exit
record looks like `::::}' followed by the function name and result of
the function.

   The number of `:'s in an entry shows its recursion depth.  You can
use the braces in the trace buffer to find the matching beginning or
end of function calls.

   You can customize trace recording for function entry and exit by
redefining the functions `edebug-print-trace-before' and
`edebug-print-trace-after'.

 - Macro: edebug-tracing STRING BODY...
     This macro requests additional trace information around the
     execution of the BODY forms.  The argument STRING specifies text
     to put in the trace buffer.  All the arguments are evaluated.
     `edebug-tracing' returns the value of the last form in BODY.

 - Function: edebug-trace FORMAT-STRING &rest FORMAT-ARGS
     This function inserts text in the trace buffer.  It computes the
     text with `(apply 'format FORMAT-STRING FORMAT-ARGS)'.  It also
     appends a newline to separate entries.

   `edebug-tracing' and `edebug-trace' insert lines in the trace buffer
even if Edebug is not active.

   Adding text to the trace buffer also scrolls its window to show the
last lines inserted.

Coverage Testing
----------------

   Edebug provides rudimentary coverage testing and display of execution
frequency.  All execution of an instrumented function accumulates
frequency counts, both before and after evaluation of each instrumented
expression, even if the execution mode is Go-nonstop.  Coverage testing
is more expensive, so it is only done if `edebug-test-coverage' is
non-`nil'.  The command `M-x edebug-display-freq-count' displays both
the frequency data and the coverage data (if recorded).

 - Command: edebug-display-freq-count
     This command displays the frequency count data for each line of the
     current definition.

     The frequency counts appear as comment lines after each line of
     code, and you can undo all insertions with one `undo' command.
     The counts appear under the `(' before an expression or the `)'
     after an expression, or on the last character of a symbol.  Values
     do not appear if they are equal to the previous count on the same
     line.

     The character `=' following the count for an expression says that
     the expression has returned the same value each time it was
     evaluated This is the only coverage information that Edebug
     records.

     To clear the frequency count and coverage data for a definition,
     reinstrument it.

   For example, after evaluating `(fac 5)' with a source breakpoint,
and setting `edebug-test-coverage' to `t', when the breakpoint is
reached, the frequency data looks like this:

     (defun fac (n)
       (if (= n 0) (edebug))
     ;#6           1      0 =5
       (if (< 0 n)
     ;#5         =
           (* n (fac (1- n)))
     ;#    5               0
         1))
     ;#   0

   The comment lines show that `fac' was called 6 times.  The first
`if' statement returned 5 times with the same result each time; the
same is true of the condition on the second `if'.  The recursive call
of `fac' did not return at all.

The Outside Context
-------------------

   Edebug tries to be transparent to the program you are debugging, but
it does not succeed completely.  Edebug also tries to be transparent
when you evaluate expressions with `e' or with the evaluation list
buffer, by temporarily restoring the outside context.  This section
explains precisely what context Edebug restores, and how Edebug fails to
be completely transparent.

Checking Whether to Stop
........................

   Whenever Edebug is entered, it needs to save and restore certain data
before even deciding whether to make trace information or stop the
program.

   * `max-lisp-eval-depth' and `max-specpdl-size' are both incremented
     one time to reduce Edebug's impact on the stack.  You could,
     however, still run out of stack space when using Edebug.

   * The state of keyboard macro execution is saved and restored.  While
     Edebug is active, `executing-macro' is bound to
     `edebug-continue-kbd-macro'.


File: elisp,  Node: Edebug Display Update,  Next: Edebug Recursive Edit,  Prev: Checking Whether to Stop,  Up: The Outside Context

Edebug Display Update
.....................

   When Edebug needs to display something (e.g., in trace mode), it
saves the current window configuration from "outside" Edebug (*note
Window Configurations::.).  When you exit Edebug (by continuing the
program), it restores the previous window configuration.

   Emacs redisplays only when it pauses.  Usually, when you continue
execution, the program comes back into Edebug at a breakpoint or after
stepping without pausing or reading input in between.  In such cases,
Emacs never gets a chance to redisplay the "outside" configuration.
What you see is the same window configuration as the last time Edebug
was active, with no interruption.

   Entry to Edebug for displaying something also saves and restores the
following data, but some of these are deliberately not restored if an
error or quit signal occurs.

   * Which buffer is current, and the positions of point and the mark
     in the current buffer, are saved and restored.

   * The outside window configuration is saved and restored if
     `edebug-save-windows' is non-`nil' (*note Edebug Display
     Update::.).

     The window configuration is not restored on error or quit, but the
     outside selected window *is* reselected even on error or quit in
     case a `save-excursion' is active.  If the value of
     `edebug-save-windows' is a list, only the listed windows are saved
     and restored.

     The window start and horizontal scrolling of the source code
     buffer are not restored, however, so that the display remains
     coherent within Edebug.

   * The value of point in each displayed buffer is saved and restored
     if `edebug-save-displayed-buffer-points' is non-`nil'.

   * The variables `overlay-arrow-position' and `overlay-arrow-string'
     are saved and restored.  So you can safely invoke Edebug from the
     recursive edit elsewhere in the same buffer.

   * `cursor-in-echo-area' is locally bound to `nil' so that the cursor
     shows up in the window.


File: elisp,  Node: Edebug Recursive Edit,  Prev: Edebug Display Update,  Up: The Outside Context

Edebug Recursive Edit
.....................

   When Edebug is entered and actually reads commands from the user, it
saves (and later restores) these additional data:

   * The current match data.  *Note Match Data::.

   * `last-command', `this-command', `last-command-char',
     `last-input-char', `last-input-event', `last-command-event',
     `last-event-frame', `last-nonmenu-event', and `track-mouse'.
     Commands used within Edebug do not affect these variables outside
     of Edebug.

     The key sequence returned by `this-command-keys' is changed by
     executing commands within Edebug and there is no way to reset the
     key sequence from Lisp.

     Edebug cannot save and restore the value of
     `unread-command-events'.  Entering Edebug while this variable has a
     nontrivial value can interfere with execution of the program you
     are debugging.

   * Complex commands executed while in Edebug are added to the variable
     `command-history'.  In rare cases this can alter execution.

   * Within Edebug, the recursion depth appears one deeper than the
     recursion depth outside Edebug.  This is not true of the
     automatically updated evaluation list window.

   * `standard-output' and `standard-input' are bound to `nil' by the
     `recursive-edit', but Edebug temporarily restores them during
     evaluations.

   * The state of keyboard macro definition is saved and restored.
     While Edebug is active, `defining-kbd-macro' is bound to
     `edebug-continue-kbd-macro'.

Instrumenting Macro Calls
-------------------------

   When Edebug instruments an expression that calls a Lisp macro, it
needs additional advice to do the job properly.  This is because there
is no way to tell which subexpressions of the macro call are forms to be
evaluated.  (Evaluation may occur explicitly in the macro body, or when
the resulting expansion is evaluated, or any time later.)  You must
explain the format of calls to each macro to enable Edebug to handle it.
To do this, use `def-edebug-spec' to define the format of calls to a
given macro.

 - Macro: def-edebug-spec MACRO SPECIFICATION
     Specify which expressions of a call to macro MACRO are forms to be
     evaluated.  For simple macros, the SPECIFICATION often looks very
     similar to the formal argument list of the macro definition, but
     specifications are much more general than macro arguments.

     The MACRO argument may actually be any symbol, not just a macro
     name.

   Here is a simple example that defines the specification for the
`for' macro described in the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, followed by
an alternative, equivalent specification.

     (def-edebug-spec for
       (symbolp "from" form "to" form "do" &rest form))
     
     (def-edebug-spec for
       (symbolp ['from form] ['to form] ['do body]))

   Here is a table of the possibilities for SPECIFICATION and how each
directs processing of arguments.

*`t'
     All arguments are instrumented for evaluation.

*`0'
     None of the arguments is instrumented.

*a symbol
     The symbol must have an Edebug specification which is used instead.
     This indirection is repeated until another kind of specification is
     found.  This allows you to inherit the specification for another
     macro.

*a list
     The elements of the list describe the types of the arguments of a
     calling form.  The possible elements of a specification list are
     described in the following sections.

* Menu:

* Specification List::		How to specify complex patterns of evaluation.
* Backtracking::		What Edebug does when matching fails.
* Specification Examples::	To help understand specifications.


File: elisp,  Node: Specification List,  Next: Backtracking,  Up: Instrumenting Macro Calls

Specification List
..................

   A "specification list" is required for an Edebug specification if
some arguments of a macro call are evaluated while others are not.  Some
elements in a specification list match one or more arguments, but others
modify the processing of all following elements.  The latter, called
"specification keywords", are symbols beginning with `&' (such as
`&optional').

   A specification list may contain sublists which match arguments that
are themselves lists, or it may contain vectors used for grouping.
Sublists and groups thus subdivide the specification list into a
hierarchy of levels.  Specification keywords only apply to the
remainder of the sublist or group they are contained in.

   When a specification list involves alternatives or repetition,
matching it against an actual macro call may require backtracking.
*Note Backtracking::, for more details.

   Edebug specifications provide the power of regular expression
matching, plus some context-free grammar constructs: the matching of
sublists with balanced parentheses, recursive processing of forms, and
recursion via indirect specifications.

   Here's a table of the possible elements of a specification list, with
their meanings:

`sexp'
     A single Lisp object, not unevaluated.

`form'
     A single evaluated expression, which is instrumented.

`place'
     A place to store a value, as in the Common Lisp `setf' construct.

`body'
     Short for `&rest form'.  See `&rest' below.

`function-form'
     A function form: either a quoted function symbol, a quoted lambda
     expression, or a form (that should evaluate to a function symbol or
     lambda expression).  This is useful when an argument that's a
     lambda expression might be quoted with `quote' rather than
     `function', since it instruments the body of the lambda expression
     either way.

`lambda-expr'
     A lambda expression with no quoting.

`&optional'
     All following elements in the specification list are optional; as
     soon as one does not match, Edebug stops matching at this level.

     To make just a few elements optional followed by non-optional
     elements, use `[&optional SPECS...]'.  To specify that several
     elements must all match or none, use `&optional [SPECS...]'.  See
     the `defun' example below.

`&rest'
     All following elements in the specification list are repeated zero
     or more times.  All the elements need not match in the last
     repetition, however.

     To repeat only a few elements, use `[&rest SPECS...]'.  To specify
     several elements that must all match on every repetition, use
     `&rest [SPECS...]'.

`&or'
     Each of the following elements in the specification list is an
     alternative.  One of the alternatives must match, or the `&or'
     specification fails.

     Each list element following `&or' is a single alternative.  To
     group two or more list elements as a single alternative, enclose
     them in `[...]'.

`&not'
     Each of the following elements is matched as alternatives as if by
     using `&or', but if any of them match, the specification fails.
     If none of them match, nothing is matched, but the `&not'
     specification succeeds.

`&define'
     Indicates that the specification is for a defining form.  The
     defining form itself is not instrumented (i.e. Edebug does not
     stop before and after the defining form), but forms inside it
     typically will be instrumented.  The `&define' keyword should be
     the first element in a list specification.

`nil'
     This is successful when there are no more arguments to match at the
     current argument list level; otherwise it fails.  See sublist
     specifications and the backquote example below.

`gate'
     No argument is matched but backtracking through the gate is
     disabled while matching the remainder of the specifications at
     this level.  This is primarily used to generate more specific
     syntax error messages.  See *Note Backtracking::, for more
     details.  Also see the `let' example below.

`OTHER-SYMBOL'
     Any other symbol in a specification list may be a predicate or an
     indirect specification.

     If the symbol has an Edebug specification, this "indirect
     specification" should be either a list specification that is used
     in place of the symbol, or a function that is called to process the
     arguments.  The specification may be defined with `def-edebug-spec'
     just as for macros. See the `defun' example below.

     Otherwise, the symbol should be a predicate.  The predicate is
     called with the argument and the specification fails if the
     predicate returns `nil'.  In either case, that argument is not
     instrumented.

     Some suitable predicates include `symbolp', `integerp', `stringp',
     `vectorp', and `atom'.

`[ELEMENTS...]'
     A vector of elements groups the elements into a single "group
     specification".  Its meaning has nothing to do with vectors.

`"STRING"'
     The argument should be a symbol named STRING.  This specification
     is equivalent to the quoted symbol, `'SYMBOL', where the name of
     SYMBOL is the STRING, but the string form is preferred.

`(vector ELEMENTS...)'
     The argument should be a vector whose elements must match the
     ELEMENTS in the specification.  See the backquote example below.

`(ELEMENTS...)'
     Any other list is a "sublist specification" and the argument must
     be a list whose elements match the specification ELEMENTS.

     A sublist specification may be a dotted list and the corresponding
     list argument may then be a dotted list.  Alternatively, the last
     CDR of a dotted list specification may be another sublist
     specification (via a grouping or an indirect specification, e.g.
     `(spec .  [(more specs...)])') whose elements match the non-dotted
     list arguments.  This is useful in recursive specifications such
     as in the backquote example below.  Also see the description of a
     `nil' specification above for terminating such recursion.

     Note that a sublist specification written as `(specs .  nil)' is
     equivalent to `(specs)', and `(specs .  (sublist-elements...))' is
     equivalent to `(specs sublist-elements...)'.

   Here is a list of additional specifications that may only appear
after `&define'.  See the `defun' example below.

`name'
     The argument, a symbol, is the name of the defining form.

     A defining form is not required to have a name field; and it may
     have multiple name fields.

`:name'
     This construct does not actually match an argument.  The element
     following `:name' should be a symbol; it is used as an additional
     name component for the definition.  You can use this to add a
     unique, static component to the name of the definition.  It may be
     used more than once.

`arg'
     The argument, a symbol, is the name of an argument of the defining
     form.  However, lambda list keywords (symbols starting with ``&'')
     are not allowed.

`lambda-list'
     This matches a lambda list--the argument list of a lambda
     expression.

`def-body'
     The argument is the body of code in a definition.  This is like
     `body', described above, but a definition body must be instrumented
     with a different Edebug call that looks up information associated
     with the definition.  Use `def-body' for the highest level list of
     forms within the definition.

`def-form'
     The argument is a single, highest-level form in a definition.
     This is like `def-body', except use this to match a single form
     rather than a list of forms.  As a special case, `def-form' also
     means that tracing information is not output when the form is
     executed.  See the `interactive' example below.

Backtracking
............

   If a specification fails to match at some point, this does not
necessarily mean a syntax error will be signaled; instead,
"backtracking" will take place until all alternatives have been
exhausted.  Eventually every element of the argument list must be
matched by some element in the specification, and every required element
in the specification must match some argument.

   Backtracking is disabled for the remainder of a sublist or group when
certain conditions occur, described below.  Backtracking is reenabled
when a new alternative is established by `&optional', `&rest', or
`&or'.  It is also reenabled initially when processing a sublist or
group specification or an indirect specification.

   You might want to disable backtracking to commit to some alternative
so that Edebug can provide a more specific syntax error message.
Normally, if no alternative matches, Edebug reports that none matched,
but if one alternative is committed to, Edebug can report how it failed
to match.

   First, backtracking is disabled while matching any of the form
specifications (i.e. `form', `body', `def-form', and `def-body').
These specifications will match any form so any error must be in the
form itself rather than at a higher level.

   Second, backtracking is disabled after successfully matching a quoted
symbol or string specification, since this usually indicates a
recognized construct.  If you have a set of alternative constructs that
all begin with the same symbol, you can usually work around this
constraint by factoring the symbol out of the alternatives, e.g.,
`["foo" &or [first case] [second case] ...]'.

   Third, backtracking may be explicitly disabled by using the `gate'
specification.  This is useful when you know that no higher
alternatives may apply.


File: elisp,  Node: Specification Examples,  Prev: Backtracking,  Up: Instrumenting Macro Calls

Specification Examples
......................

   It may be easier to understand Edebug specifications by studying the
examples provided here.

   A `let' special form has a sequence of bindings and a body.  Each of
the bindings is either a symbol or a sublist with a symbol and optional
value.  In the specification below, notice the `gate' inside of the
sublist to prevent backtracking once a sublist is found.

     (def-edebug-spec let
       ((&rest
         &or symbolp (gate symbolp &optional form))
        body))

   Edebug uses the following specifications for `defun' and `defmacro'
and the associated argument list and `interactive' specifications.  It
is necessary to handle interactive forms specially since an expression
argument it is actually evaluated outside of the function body.

     (def-edebug-spec defmacro defun) ; Indirect ref to `defun' spec.
     (def-edebug-spec defun
       (&define name lambda-list
                [&optional stringp]   ; Match the doc string, if present.
                [&optional ("interactive" interactive)]
                def-body))
     
     (def-edebug-spec lambda-list
       (([&rest arg]
         [&optional ["&optional" arg &rest arg]]
         &optional ["&rest" arg]
         )))
     
     (def-edebug-spec interactive
       (&optional &or stringp def-form))    ; Notice: `def-form'

   The specification for backquote below illustrates how to match
dotted lists and use `nil' to terminate recursion.  It also illustrates
how components of a vector may be matched.  (The actual specification
defined by Edebug does not support dotted lists because doing so causes
very deep recursion that could fail.)

     (def-edebug-spec ` (backquote-form))   ; Alias just for clarity.
     
     (def-edebug-spec backquote-form
       (&or ([&or "," ",@"] &or ("quote" backquote-form) form)
            (backquote-form . [&or nil backquote-form])
            (vector &rest backquote-form)
            sexp))

Edebug Options
--------------

   These options affect the behavior of Edebug:

 - User Option: edebug-setup-hook
     Functions to call before Edebug is used.  Each time it is set to a
     new value, Edebug will call those functions once and then
     `edebug-setup-hook' is reset to `nil'.  You could use this to load
     up Edebug specifications associated with a package you are using
     but only when you also use Edebug.  *Note Instrumenting::.

 - User Option: edebug-all-defs
     If this is non-`nil', normal evaluation of defining forms such as
     `defun' and `defmacro' instruments them for Edebug.  This applies
     to `eval-defun', `eval-region', `eval-buffer', and
     `eval-current-buffer'.

     Use the command `M-x edebug-all-defs' to toggle the value of this
     option.  *Note Instrumenting::.

 - User Option: edebug-all-forms
     If this is non-`nil', the commands `eval-defun', `eval-region',
     `eval-buffer', and `eval-current-buffer' instrument all forms,
     even those that don't define anything.  This doesn't apply to
     loading or evaluations in the minibuffer.

     Use the command `M-x edebug-all-forms' to toggle the value of this
     option.  *Note Instrumenting::.

 - User Option: edebug-save-windows
     If this is non-`nil', Edebug saves and restores the window
     configuration.  That takes some time, so if your program does not
     care what happens to the window configurations, it is better to
     set this variable to `nil'.

     If the value is a list, only the listed windows are saved and
     restored.

     You can use the `W' command in Edebug to change this variable
     interactively.  *Note Edebug Display Update::.

 - User Option: edebug-save-displayed-buffer-points
     If this is non-`nil', Edebug saves and restores point in all
     displayed buffers.

     Saving and restoring point in other buffers is necessary if you are
     debugging code that changes the point of a buffer which is
     displayed in a non-selected window.  If Edebug or the user then
     selects the window, point in that buffer will move to the window's
     value of point.

     Saving and restoring point in all buffers is expensive, since it
     requires selecting each window twice, so enable this only if you
     need it.  *Note Edebug Display Update::.

 - User Option: edebug-initial-mode
     If this variable is non-`nil', it specifies the initial execution
     mode for Edebug when it is first activated.  Possible values are
     `step', `next', `go', `Go-nonstop', `trace', `Trace-fast',
     `continue', and `Continue-fast'.

     The default value is `step'.  *Note Edebug Execution Modes::.

 - User Option: edebug-trace
     Non-`nil' means display a trace of function entry and exit.
     Tracing output is displayed in a buffer named `*edebug-trace*', one
     function entry or exit per line, indented by the recursion level.

     The default value is `nil'.

     Also see `edebug-tracing', in *Note Trace Buffer::.

 - User Option: edebug-test-coverage
     If non-`nil', Edebug tests coverage of all expressions debugged.
     This is done by comparing the result of each expression with the
     previous result. Coverage is considered OK if two different
     results are found.  So to sufficiently test the coverage of your
     code, try to execute it under conditions that evaluate all
     expressions more than once, and produce different results for each
     expression.

     Use `M-x edebug-display-freq-count' to display the frequency count
     and coverage information for a definition.  *Note Coverage
     Testing::.

 - User Option: edebug-continue-kbd-macro
     If non-`nil', continue defining or executing any keyboard macro
     that is executing outside of Edebug.   Use this with caution since
     it is not debugged.  *Note Edebug Execution Modes::.

 - User Option: edebug-print-length
     If non-`nil', bind `print-length' to this while printing results
     in Edebug.  The default value is `50'.  *Note Printing in Edebug::.

 - User Option: edebug-print-level
     If non-`nil', bind `print-level' to this while printing results in
     Edebug.  The default value is `50'.

 - User Option: edebug-print-circle
     If non-`nil', bind `print-circle' to this while printing results
     in Edebug.  The default value is `nil'.

 - User Option: edebug-on-error
     Edebug binds `debug-on-error' to this value, if `debug-on-error'
     was previously `nil'.  *Note Trapping Errors::.

 - User Option: edebug-on-quit
     Edebug binds `debug-on-quit' to this value, if `debug-on-quit' was
     previously `nil'.  *Note Trapping Errors::.

   If you change the values of `edebug-on-error' or `edebug-on-quit'
while Edebug is active, their values won't be used until the *next*
time Edebug is invoked via a new command.

 - User Option: edebug-global-break-condition
     If non-`nil', an expression to test for at every stop point.  If
     the result is non-nil, then break.  Errors are ignored.  *Note

Reading and Printing Lisp Objects
*********************************

   "Printing" and "reading" are the operations of converting Lisp
objects to textual form and vice versa.  They use the printed
representations and read syntax described in *Note Lisp Data Types::.

   This chapter describes the Lisp functions for reading and printing.
It also describes "streams", which specify where to get the text (if
reading) or where to put it (if printing).

Introduction to Reading and Printing
====================================

   "Reading" a Lisp object means parsing a Lisp expression in textual
form and producing a corresponding Lisp object.  This is how Lisp
programs get into Lisp from files of Lisp code.  We call the text the
"read syntax" of the object.  For example, the text `(a . 5)' is the
read syntax for a cons cell whose CAR is `a' and whose CDR is the
number 5.

   "Printing" a Lisp object means producing text that represents that
object--converting the object to its printed representation.  Printing
the cons cell described above produces the text `(a . 5)'.

   Reading and printing are more or less inverse operations: printing
the object that results from reading a given piece of text often
produces the same text, and reading the text that results from printing
an object usually produces a similar-looking object.  For example,
printing the symbol `foo' produces the text `foo', and reading that text
returns the symbol `foo'.  Printing a list whose elements are `a' and
`b' produces the text `(a b)', and reading that text produces a list
(but not the same list) with elements `a' and `b'.

   However, these two operations are not precisely inverses.  There are
two kinds of exceptions:

   * Printing can produce text that cannot be read.  For example,
     buffers, windows, frames, subprocesses and markers print into text
     that starts with `#'; if you try to read this text, you get an
     error.  There is no way to read those data types.

   * One object can have multiple textual representations.  For example,
     `1' and `01' represent the same integer, and `(a b)' and `(a .
     (b))' represent the same list.  Reading will accept any of the
     alternatives, but printing must choose one of them.

Input Streams
=============

   Most of the Lisp functions for reading text take an "input stream"
as an argument.  The input stream specifies where or how to get the
characters of the text to be read.  Here are the possible types of input
stream:

BUFFER
     The input characters are read from BUFFER, starting with the
     character directly after point.  Point advances as characters are
     read.

MARKER
     The input characters are read from the buffer that MARKER is in,
     starting with the character directly after the marker.  The marker
     position advances as characters are read.  The value of point in
     the buffer has no effect when the stream is a marker.

STRING
     The input characters are taken from STRING, starting at the first
     character in the string and using as many characters as required.

FUNCTION
     The input characters are generated by FUNCTION, one character per
     call.  Normally FUNCTION is called with no arguments, and should
     return a character.

     Occasionally FUNCTION is called with one argument (always a
     character).  When that happens, FUNCTION should save the argument
     and arrange to return it on the next call.  This is called
     "unreading" the character; it happens when the Lisp reader reads
     one character too many and wants to "put it back where it came
     from".

`t'
     `t' used as a stream means that the input is read from the
     minibuffer.  In fact, the minibuffer is invoked once and the text
     given by the user is made into a string that is then used as the
     input stream.

`nil'
     `nil' supplied as an input stream means to use the value of
     `standard-input' instead; that value is the "default input
     stream", and must be a non-`nil' input stream.

SYMBOL
     A symbol as input stream is equivalent to the symbol's function
     definition (if any).

   Here is an example of reading from a stream that is a buffer, showing
where point is located before and after:

     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This-!- is the contents of foo.
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     (read (get-buffer "foo"))
          => is
     (read (get-buffer "foo"))
          => the
     
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is the-!- contents of foo.
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------

Note that the first read skips a space.  Reading skips any amount of
whitespace preceding the significant text.

   In Emacs 18, reading a symbol discarded the delimiter terminating the
symbol.  Thus, point would end up at the beginning of `contents' rather
than after `the'.  The Emacs 19 behavior is superior because it
correctly handles input such as `bar(foo)', where the delimiter that
ends one object is needed as the beginning of another object.

   Here is an example of reading from a stream that is a marker,
initially positioned at the beginning of the buffer shown.  The value
read is the symbol `This'.


     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is the contents of foo.
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     (setq m (set-marker (make-marker) 1 (get-buffer "foo")))
          => #<marker at 1 in foo>
     (read m)
          => This
     m
          => #<marker at 5 in foo>   ;; Before the first space.

   Here we read from the contents of a string:

     (read "(When in) the course")
          => (When in)

   The following example reads from the minibuffer.  The prompt is:
`Lisp expression: '.  (That is always the prompt used when you read
from the stream `t'.)  The user's input is shown following the prompt.

     (read t)
          => 23
     ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
     Lisp expression: `23 RET'
     ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

   Finally, here is an example of a stream that is a function, named
`useless-stream'.  Before we use the stream, we initialize the variable
`useless-list' to a list of characters.  Then each call to the function
`useless-stream' obtains the next character in the list or unreads a
character by adding it to the front of the list.

     (setq useless-list (append "XY()" nil))
          => (88 89 40 41)
     
     (defun useless-stream (&optional unread)
       (if unread
           (setq useless-list (cons unread useless-list))
         (prog1 (car useless-list)
                (setq useless-list (cdr useless-list)))))
          => useless-stream

Now we read using the stream thus constructed:

     (read 'useless-stream)
          => XY
     
     useless-list
          => (40 41)

Note that the open and close parentheses remains in the list.  The Lisp
reader encountered the open parenthesis, decided that it ended the
input, and unread it.  Another attempt to read from the stream at this
point would read `()' and return `nil'.

 - Function: get-file-char
     This function is used internally as an input stream to read from
     the input file opened by the function `load'.  Don't use this
     function yourself.

Input Functions
===============

   This section describes the Lisp functions and variables that pertain
to reading.

   In the functions below, STREAM stands for an input stream (see the
previous section).  If STREAM is `nil' or omitted, it defaults to the
value of `standard-input'.

   An `end-of-file' error is signaled if reading encounters an
unterminated list, vector, or string.

 - Function: read &optional STREAM
     This function reads one textual Lisp expression from STREAM,
     returning it as a Lisp object.  This is the basic Lisp input
     function.

 - Function: read-from-string STRING &optional START END
     This function reads the first textual Lisp expression from the
     text in STRING.  It returns a cons cell whose CAR is that
     expression, and whose CDR is an integer giving the position of the
     next remaining character in the string (i.e., the first one not
     read).

     If START is supplied, then reading begins at index START in the
     string (where the first character is at index 0).  If END is also
     supplied, then reading stops just before that index, as if the rest
     of the string were not there.

     For example:

          (read-from-string "(setq x 55) (setq y 5)")
               => ((setq x 55) . 11)
          (read-from-string "\"A short string\"")
               => ("A short string" . 16)
          
          ;; Read starting at the first character.
          (read-from-string "(list 112)" 0)
               => ((list 112) . 10)
          ;; Read starting at the second character.
          (read-from-string "(list 112)" 1)
               => (list . 5)
          ;; Read starting at the seventh character,
          ;;   and stopping at the ninth.
          (read-from-string "(list 112)" 6 8)
               => (11 . 8)

 - Variable: standard-input
     This variable holds the default input stream--the stream that
     `read' uses when the STREAM argument is `nil'.


File: elisp,  Node: Output Streams,  Next: Output Functions,  Prev: Input Functions,  Up: Read and Print

Output Streams
==============

   An output stream specifies what to do with the characters produced
by printing.  Most print functions accept an output stream as an
optional argument.  Here are the possible types of output stream:

BUFFER
     The output characters are inserted into BUFFER at point.  Point
     advances as characters are inserted.

MARKER
     The output characters are inserted into the buffer that MARKER
     points into, at the marker position.  The marker position advances
     as characters are inserted.  The value of point in the buffer has
     no effect on printing when the stream is a marker.

FUNCTION
     The output characters are passed to FUNCTION, which is responsible
     for storing them away.  It is called with a single character as
     argument, as many times as there are characters to be output, and
     is free to do anything at all with the characters it receives.

`t'
     The output characters are displayed in the echo area.

`nil'
     `nil' specified as an output stream means to the value of
     `standard-output' instead; that value is the "default output
     stream", and must be a non-`nil' output stream.

SYMBOL
     A symbol as output stream is equivalent to the symbol's function
     definition (if any).

   Many of the valid output streams are also valid as input streams.
The difference between input and output streams is therefore mostly one
of how you use a Lisp object, not a distinction of types of object.

   Here is an example of a buffer used as an output stream.  Point is
initially located as shown immediately before the `h' in `the'.  At the
end, point is located directly before that same `h'.

     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is t-!-he contents of foo.
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     (print "This is the output" (get-buffer "foo"))
          => "This is the output"
     
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is t
     "This is the output"
     -!-he contents of foo.
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------

   Now we show a use of a marker as an output stream.  Initially, the
marker is in buffer `foo', between the `t' and the `h' in the word
`the'.  At the end, the marker has advanced over the inserted text so
that it remains positioned before the same `h'.  Note that the location
of point, shown in the usual fashion, has no effect.

     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     "This is the -!-output"
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     m
          => #<marker at 11 in foo>
     
     (print "More output for foo." m)
          => "More output for foo."
     
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     "This is t
     "More output for foo."
     he -!-output"
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     m
          => #<marker at 35 in foo>

   The following example shows output to the echo area:

     (print "Echo Area output" t)
          => "Echo Area output"
     ---------- Echo Area ----------
     "Echo Area output"
     ---------- Echo Area ----------

   Finally, we show the use of a function as an output stream.  The
function `eat-output' takes each character that it is given and conses
it onto the front of the list `last-output' (*note Building Lists::.).
At the end, the list contains all the characters output, but in reverse
order.

     (setq last-output nil)
          => nil
     
     (defun eat-output (c)
       (setq last-output (cons c last-output)))
          => eat-output
     
     (print "This is the output" 'eat-output)
          => "This is the output"
     
     last-output
          => (10 34 116 117 112 116 117 111 32 101 104
         116 32 115 105 32 115 105 104 84 34 10)

Now we can put the output in the proper order by reversing the list:

     (concat (nreverse last-output))
          => "
     \"This is the output\"
     "

Calling `concat' converts the list to a string so you can see its
contents more clearly.

Output Functions
================

   This section describes the Lisp functions for printing Lisp objects.

   Some of the Emacs printing functions add quoting characters to the
output when necessary so that it can be read properly.  The quoting
characters used are `"' and `\'; they distinguish strings from symbols,
and prevent punctuation characters in strings and symbols from being
taken as delimiters when reading.  *Note Printed Representation::, for
full details.  You specify quoting or no quoting by the choice of
printing function.

   If the text is to be read back into Lisp, then it is best to print
with quoting characters to avoid ambiguity.  Likewise, if the purpose is
to describe a Lisp object clearly for a Lisp programmer.  However, if
the purpose of the output is to look nice for humans, then it is better
to print without quoting.

   Printing a self-referent Lisp object requires an infinite amount of
text.  In certain cases, trying to produce this text leads to a stack
overflow.  Emacs detects such recursion and prints `#LEVEL' instead of
recursively printing an object already being printed.  For example,
here `#0' indicates a recursive reference to the object at level 0 of
the current print operation:

     (setq foo (list nil))
          => (nil)
     (setcar foo foo)
          => (#0)

   In the functions below, STREAM stands for an output stream.  (See
the previous section for a description of output streams.)  If STREAM
is `nil' or omitted, it defaults to the value of `standard-output'.

 - Function: print OBJECT &optional STREAM
     The `print' function is a convenient way of printing.  It outputs
     the printed representation of OBJECT to STREAM, printing in
     addition one newline before OBJECT and another after it.  Quoting
     characters are used.  `print' returns OBJECT.  For example:

          (progn (print 'The\ cat\ in)
                 (print "the hat")
                 (print " came back"))
               -|
               -| The\ cat\ in
               -|
               -| "the hat"
               -|
               -| " came back"
               -|
               => " came back"

 - Function: prin1 OBJECT &optional STREAM
     This function outputs the printed representation of OBJECT to
     STREAM.  It does not print newlines to separate output as `print'
     does, but it does use quoting characters just like `print'.  It
     returns OBJECT.

          (progn (prin1 'The\ cat\ in)
                 (prin1 "the hat")
                 (prin1 " came back"))
               -| The\ cat\ in"the hat"" came back"
               => " came back"

 - Function: princ OBJECT &optional STREAM
     This function outputs the printed representation of OBJECT to
     STREAM.  It returns OBJECT.

     This function is intended to produce output that is readable by
     people, not by `read', so it doesn't insert quoting characters and
     doesn't put double-quotes around the contents of strings.  It does
     not add any spacing between calls.

          (progn
            (princ 'The\ cat)
            (princ " in the \"hat\""))
               -| The cat in the "hat"
               => " in the \"hat\""

 - Function: terpri &optional STREAM
     This function outputs a newline to STREAM.  The name stands for
     "terminate print".

 - Function: write-char CHARACTER &optional STREAM
     This function outputs CHARACTER to STREAM.  It returns CHARACTER.

 - Function: prin1-to-string OBJECT &optional NOESCAPE
     This function returns a string containing the text that `prin1'
     would have printed for the same argument.

          (prin1-to-string 'foo)
               => "foo"
          (prin1-to-string (mark-marker))
               => "#<marker at 2773 in strings.texi>"

     If NOESCAPE is non-`nil', that inhibits use of quoting characters
     in the output.  (This argument is supported in Emacs versions 19
     and later.)

          (prin1-to-string "foo")
               => "\"foo\""
          (prin1-to-string "foo" t)
               => "foo"

     See `format', in *Note String Conversion::, for other ways to
     obtain the printed representation of a Lisp object as a string.

Variables Affecting Output
==========================

 - Variable: standard-output
     The value of this variable is the default output stream--the stream
     that print functions use when the STREAM argument is `nil'.

 - Variable: print-escape-newlines
     If this variable is non-`nil', then newline characters in strings
     are printed as `\n' and formfeeds are printed as `\f'.  Normally
     these characters are printed as actual newlines and formfeeds.

     This variable affects the print functions `prin1' and `print', as
     well as everything that uses them.  It does not affect `princ'.
     Here is an example using `prin1':

          (prin1 "a\nb")
               -| "a
               -| b"
               => "a
          b"
          
          (let ((print-escape-newlines t))
            (prin1 "a\nb"))
               -| "a\nb"
               => "a
          b"

     In the second expression, the local binding of
     `print-escape-newlines' is in effect during the call to `prin1',
     but not during the printing of the result.

 - Variable: print-length
     The value of this variable is the maximum number of elements of a
     list that will be printed.  If a list being printed has more than
     this many elements, it is abbreviated with an ellipsis.

     If the value is `nil' (the default), then there is no limit.

          (setq print-length 2)
               => 2
          (print '(1 2 3 4 5))
               -| (1 2 ...)
               => (1 2 ...)

 - Variable: print-level
     The value of this variable is the maximum depth of nesting of
     parentheses and brackets when printed.  Any list or vector at a
     depth exceeding this limit is abbreviated with an ellipsis.  A
     value of `nil' (which is the default) means no limit.

     This variable exists in version 19 and later versions.
