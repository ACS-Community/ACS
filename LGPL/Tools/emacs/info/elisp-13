Introduction to Minibuffers
===========================

   In most ways, a minibuffer is a normal Emacs buffer.  Most operations
*within* a buffer, such as editing commands, work normally in a
minibuffer.  However, many operations for managing buffers do not apply
to minibuffers.  The name of a minibuffer always has the form
` *Minibuf-NUMBER', and it cannot be changed.  Minibuffers are
displayed only in special windows used only for minibuffers; these
windows always appear at the bottom of a frame.  (Sometime frames have
no minibuffer window, and sometimes a special kind of frame contains
nothing but a minibuffer window; see *Note Minibuffers and Frames::.)

   The minibuffer's window is normally a single line.  You can resize it
temporarily with the window sizing commands; it reverts to its normal
size when the minibuffer is exited.  You can resize it permanently by
using the window sizing commands in the frame's other window, when the
minibuffer is not active.  If the frame contains just a minibuffer, you
can change the minibuffer's size by changing the frame's size.

   If a command uses a minibuffer while there is an active minibuffer,
this is called a "recursive minibuffer".  The first minibuffer is named
` *Minibuf-0*'.  Recursive minibuffers are named by incrementing the
number at the end of the name.  (The names begin with a space so that
they won't show up in normal buffer lists.)  Of several recursive
minibuffers, the innermost (or most recently entered) is the active
minibuffer.  We usually call this "the" minibuffer.  You can permit or
forbid recursive minibuffers by setting the variable
`enable-recursive-minibuffers' or by putting properties of that name on
command symbols (*note Minibuffer Misc::.).

   Like other buffers, a minibuffer may use any of several local keymaps
(*note Keymaps::.); these contain various exit commands and in some
cases completion commands.  *Note Completion::.

   * `minibuffer-local-map' is for ordinary input (no completion).

   * `minibuffer-local-ns-map' is similar, except that SPC exits just
     like RET.  This is used mainly for Mocklisp compatibility.

   * `minibuffer-local-completion-map' is for permissive completion.

   * `minibuffer-local-must-match-map' is for strict completion and for
     cautious completion.

Reading Text Strings with the Minibuffer
========================================

   Most often, the minibuffer is used to read text as a string.  It can
also be used to read a Lisp object in textual form.  The most basic
primitive for minibuffer input is `read-from-minibuffer'; it can do
either one.

 - Function: read-from-minibuffer PROMPT-STRING &optional
          INITIAL-CONTENTS KEYMAP READ HIST
     This function is the most general way to get input through the
     minibuffer.  By default, it accepts arbitrary text and returns it
     as a string; however, if READ is non-`nil', then it uses `read' to
     convert the text into a Lisp object (*note Input Functions::.).

     The first thing this function does is to activate a minibuffer and
     display it with PROMPT-STRING as the prompt.  This value must be a
     string.

     Then, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string, `read-from-minibuffer'
     inserts it into the minibuffer, leaving point at the end.  The
     minibuffer appears with this text as its contents.

     The value of INITIAL-CONTENTS may also be a cons cell of the form
     `(STRING . POSITION)'.  This means to insert STRING in the
     minibuffer but put point POSITION characters from the beginning,
     rather than at the end.

     If KEYMAP is non-`nil', that keymap is the local keymap to use in
     the minibuffer.  If KEYMAP is omitted or `nil', the value of
     `minibuffer-local-map' is used as the keymap.  Specifying a keymap
     is the most important way to customize the minibuffer for various
     applications such as completion.

     The argument HIST specifies which history list variable to use for
     saving the input and for history commands used in the minibuffer.
     It defaults to `minibuffer-history'.  *Note Minibuffer History::.

     When the user types a command to exit the minibuffer,
     `read-from-minibuffer' uses the text in the minibuffer to produce
     its return value.  Normally it simply makes a string containing
     that text.  However, if READ is non-`nil', `read-from-minibuffer'
     reads the text and returns the resulting Lisp object, unevaluated.
     (*Note Input Functions::, for information about reading.)

 - Function: read-string PROMPT &optional INITIAL
     This function reads a string from the minibuffer and returns it.
     The arguments PROMPT and INITIAL are used as in
     `read-from-minibuffer'.  The keymap used is `minibuffer-local-map'.

     This is a simplified interface to the `read-from-minibuffer'
     function:

          (read-string PROMPT INITIAL)
          ==
          (read-from-minibuffer PROMPT INITIAL nil nil nil)

 - Variable: minibuffer-local-map
     This is the default local keymap for reading from the minibuffer.
     By default, it makes the following bindings:

    LFD
          `exit-minibuffer'

    RET
          `exit-minibuffer'

    `C-g'
          `abort-recursive-edit'

    `M-n'
          `next-history-element'

    `M-p'
          `previous-history-element'

    `M-r'
          `next-matching-history-element'

    `M-s'
          `previous-matching-history-element'

 - Function: read-no-blanks-input PROMPT &optional INITIAL
     This function reads a string from the minibuffer, but does not
     allow whitespace characters as part of the input: instead, those
     characters terminate the input.  The arguments PROMPT and INITIAL
     are used as in `read-from-minibuffer'.

     This is a simplified interface to the `read-from-minibuffer'
     function, and passes the value of the `minibuffer-local-ns-map'
     keymap as the KEYMAP argument for that function.  Since the keymap
     `minibuffer-local-ns-map' does not rebind `C-q', it *is* possible
     to put a space into the string, by quoting it.

          (read-no-blanks-input PROMPT INITIAL)
          ==
          (read-from-minibuffer PROMPT INITIAL minibuffer-local-ns-map)

 - Variable: minibuffer-local-ns-map
     This built-in variable is the keymap used as the minibuffer local
     keymap in the function `read-no-blanks-input'.  By default, it
     makes the following bindings:

    LFD
          `exit-minibuffer'

    SPC
          `exit-minibuffer'

    TAB
          `exit-minibuffer'

    RET
          `exit-minibuffer'

    `C-g'
          `abort-recursive-edit'

    `?'
          `self-insert-and-exit'

    `M-n'
          `next-history-element'

    `M-p'
          `previous-history-element'

    `M-r'
          `next-matching-history-element'

    `M-s'
          `previous-matching-history-element'

Reading Lisp Objects with the Minibuffer
========================================

   This section describes functions for reading Lisp objects with the
minibuffer.

 - Function: read-minibuffer PROMPT &optional INITIAL
     This function reads a Lisp object in the minibuffer and returns it,
     without evaluating it.  The arguments PROMPT and INITIAL are used
     as in `read-from-minibuffer'.

     This is a simplified interface to the `read-from-minibuffer'
     function:

          (read-minibuffer PROMPT INITIAL)
          ==
          (read-from-minibuffer PROMPT INITIAL nil t)

     Here is an example in which we supply the string `"(testing)"' as
     initial input:

          (read-minibuffer
           "Enter an expression: " (format "%s" '(testing)))
          
          ;; Here is how the minibuffer is displayed:

          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          Enter an expression: (testing)-!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

     The user can type RET immediately to use the initial input as a
     default, or can edit the input.

 - Function: eval-minibuffer PROMPT &optional INITIAL
     This function reads a Lisp expression in the minibuffer, evaluates
     it, then returns the result.  The arguments PROMPT and INITIAL are
     used as in `read-from-minibuffer'.

     This function simply evaluates the result of a call to
     `read-minibuffer':

          (eval-minibuffer PROMPT INITIAL)
          ==
          (eval (read-minibuffer PROMPT INITIAL))

 - Function: edit-and-eval-command PROMPT FORM
     This function reads a Lisp expression in the minibuffer, and then
     evaluates it.  The difference between this command and
     `eval-minibuffer' is that here the initial FORM is not optional
     and it is treated as a Lisp object to be converted to printed
     representation rather than as a string of text.  It is printed with
     `prin1', so if it is a string, double-quote characters (`"')
     appear in the initial text.  *Note Output Functions::.

     The first thing `edit-and-eval-command' does is to activate the
     minibuffer with PROMPT as the prompt.  Then it inserts the printed
     representation of FORM in the minibuffer, and lets the user edit.
     When the user exits the minibuffer, the edited text is read with
     `read' and then evaluated.  The resulting value becomes the value
     of `edit-and-eval-command'.

     In the following example, we offer the user an expression with
     initial text which is a valid form already:

          (edit-and-eval-command "Please edit: " '(forward-word 1))
          
          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following appears in the minibuffer:

          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          Please edit: (forward-word 1)-!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

     Typing RET right away would exit the minibuffer and evaluate the
     expression, thus moving point forward one word.
     `edit-and-eval-command' returns `nil' in this example.

Minibuffer History
==================

   A "minibuffer history list" records previous minibuffer inputs so
the user can reuse them conveniently.  A history list is actually a
symbol, not a list; it is a variable whose value is a list of strings
(previous inputs), most recent first.

   There are many separate history lists, used for different kinds of
inputs.  It's the Lisp programmer's job to specify the right history
list for each use of the minibuffer.

   The basic minibuffer input functions `read-from-minibuffer' and
`completing-read' both accept an optional argument named HIST which is
how you specify the history list.  Here are the possible values:

VARIABLE
     Use VARIABLE (a symbol) as the history list.

(VARIABLE . STARTPOS)
     Use VARIABLE (a symbol) as the history list, and assume that the
     initial history position is STARTPOS (an integer, counting from
     zero which specifies the most recent element of the history).

     If you specify STARTPOS, then you should also specify that element
     of the history as the initial minibuffer contents, for consistency.

   If you don't specify HIST, then the default history list
`minibuffer-history' is used.  For other standard history lists, see
below.  You can also create your own history list variable; just
initialize it to `nil' before the first use.

   Both `read-from-minibuffer' and `completing-read' add new elements
to the history list automatically, and provide commands to allow the
user to reuse items on the list.  The only thing your program needs to
do to use a history list is to initialize it and to pass its name to
the input functions when you wish.  But it is safe to modify the list
by hand when the minibuffer input functions are not using it.

 - Variable: minibuffer-history
     The default history list for minibuffer history input.

 - Variable: query-replace-history
     A history list for arguments to `query-replace' (and similar
     arguments to other commands).

 - Variable: file-name-history
     A history list for file name arguments.

 - Variable: regexp-history
     A history list for regular expression arguments.

 - Variable: extended-command-history
     A history list for arguments that are names of extended commands.

 - Variable: shell-command-history
     A history list for arguments that are shell commands.

 - Variable: read-expression-history
     A history list for arguments that are Lisp expressions to evaluate.

Completion
==========

   "Completion" is a feature that fills in the rest of a name starting
from an abbreviation for it.  Completion works by comparing the user's
input against a list of valid names and determining how much of the
name is determined uniquely by what the user has typed.  For example,
when you type `C-x b' (`switch-to-buffer') and then type the first few
letters of the name of the buffer to which you wish to switch, and then
type TAB (`minibuffer-complete'), Emacs extends the name as far as it
can.

   Standard Emacs commands offer completion for names of symbols, files,
buffers, and processes; with the functions in this section, you can
implement completion for other kinds of names.

   The `try-completion' function is the basic primitive for completion:
it returns the longest determined completion of a given initial string,
with a given set of strings to match against.

   The function `completing-read' provides a higher-level interface for
completion.  A call to `completing-read' specifies how to determine the
list of valid names.  The function then activates the minibuffer with a
local keymap that binds a few keys to commands useful for completion.
Other functions provide convenient simple interfaces for reading
certain kinds of names with completion.

Basic Completion Functions
--------------------------

   The two functions `try-completion' and `all-completions' have
nothing in themselves to do with minibuffers.  We describe them in this
chapter so as to keep them near the higher-level completion features
that do use the minibuffer.

 - Function: try-completion STRING COLLECTION &optional PREDICATE
     This function returns the longest common substring of all possible
     completions of STRING in COLLECTION.  The value of COLLECTION must
     be an alist, an obarray, or a function that implements a virtual
     set of strings (see below).

     Completion compares STRING against each of the permissible
     completions specified by COLLECTION; if the beginning of the
     permissible completion equals STRING, it matches.  If no
     permissible completions match, `try-completion' returns `nil'.  If
     only one permissible completion matches, and the match is exact,
     then `try-completion' returns `t'.  Otherwise, the value is the
     longest initial sequence common to all the permissible completions
     that match.

     If COLLECTION is an alist (*note Association Lists::.), the CARs
     of the alist elements form the set of permissible completions.

     If COLLECTION is an obarray (*note Creating Symbols::.), the names
     of all symbols in the obarray form the set of permissible
     completions.  The global variable `obarray' holds an obarray
     containing the names of all interned Lisp symbols.

     Note that the only valid way to make a new obarray is to create it
     empty and then add symbols to it one by one using `intern'.  Also,
     you cannot intern a given symbol in more than one obarray.

     If the argument PREDICATE is non-`nil', then it must be a function
     of one argument.  It is used to test each possible match, and the
     match is accepted only if PREDICATE returns non-`nil'.  The
     argument given to PREDICATE is either a cons cell from the alist
     (the CAR of which is a string) or else it is a symbol (*not* a
     symbol name) from the obarray.

     You can also use a symbol that is a function as COLLECTION.  Then
     the function is solely responsible for performing completion;
     `try-completion' returns whatever this function returns.  The
     function is called with three arguments: STRING, PREDICATE and
     `nil'.  (The reason for the third argument is so that the same
     function can be used in `all-completions' and do the appropriate
     thing in either case.)  *Note Programmed Completion::.

     In the first of the following examples, the string `foo' is
     matched by three of the alist CARs.  All of the matches begin with
     the characters `fooba', so that is the result.  In the second
     example, there is only one possible match, and it is exact, so the
     value is `t'.

          (try-completion
           "foo"
           '(("foobar1" 1) ("barfoo" 2) ("foobaz" 3) ("foobar2" 4)))
               => "fooba"

          (try-completion "foo" '(("barfoo" 2) ("foo" 3)))
               => t

     In the following example, numerous symbols begin with the
     characters `forw', and all of them begin with the word `forward'.
     In most of the symbols, this is followed with a `-', but not in
     all, so no more than `forward' can be completed.

          (try-completion "forw" obarray)
               => "forward"

     Finally, in the following example, only two of the three possible
     matches pass the predicate `test' (the string `foobaz' is too
     short).  Both of those begin with the string `foobar'.

          (defun test (s)
            (> (length (car s)) 6))
               => test

          (try-completion
           "foo"
           '(("foobar1" 1) ("barfoo" 2) ("foobaz" 3) ("foobar2" 4))
           'test)
               => "foobar"

 - Function: all-completions STRING COLLECTION &optional PREDICATE
     This function returns a list of all possible completions of
     STRING.  The parameters to this function are the same as to
     `try-completion'.

     If COLLECTION is a function, it is called with three arguments:
     STRING, PREDICATE and `t'; then `all-completions' returns whatever
     the function returns.  *Note Programmed Completion::.

     Here is an example, using the function `test' shown in the example
     for `try-completion':

          (defun test (s)
            (> (length (car s)) 6))
               => test

          (all-completions
           "foo"
           '(("foobar1" 1) ("barfoo" 2) ("foobaz" 3) ("foobar2" 4))
           'test)
               => ("foobar1" "foobar2")

 - Variable: completion-ignore-case
     If the value of this variable is non-`nil', Emacs does not
     consider case significant in completion.

Completion and the Minibuffer
-----------------------------

   This section describes the basic interface for reading from the
minibuffer with completion.

 - Function: completing-read PROMPT COLLECTION &optional PREDICATE
          REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL HIST
     This function reads a string in the minibuffer, assisting the user
     by providing completion.  It activates the minibuffer with prompt
     PROMPT, which must be a string.  If INITIAL is non-`nil',
     `completing-read' inserts it into the minibuffer as part of the
     input.  Then it allows the user to edit the input, providing
     several commands to attempt completion.

     The actual completion is done by passing COLLECTION and PREDICATE
     to the function `try-completion'.  This happens in certain
     commands bound in the local keymaps used for completion.

     If REQUIRE-MATCH is `t', the usual minibuffer exit commands won't
     exit unless the input completes to an element of COLLECTION.  If
     REQUIRE-MATCH is neither `nil' nor `t', then the exit commands
     won't exit unless the input typed is itself an element of
     COLLECTION.  If REQUIRE-MATCH is `nil', the exit commands work
     regardless of the input in the minibuffer.

     The function `completing-read' works by calling `read-minibuffer'.
     It uses `minibuffer-local-completion-map' as the keymap if
     REQUIRE-MATCH is `nil', and uses `minibuffer-local-must-match-map'
     if REQUIRE-MATCH is non-`nil'.  *Note Completion Commands::.

     The argument HIST specifies which history list variable to use for
     saving the input and for minibuffer history commands.  It defaults
     to `minibuffer-history'.  *Note Minibuffer History::.

     Completion ignores case when comparing the input against the
     possible matches, if the built-in variable
     `completion-ignore-case' is non-`nil'.  *Note Basic Completion::.

     Here's an example of using `completing-read':

          (completing-read
           "Complete a foo: "
           '(("foobar1" 1) ("barfoo" 2) ("foobaz" 3) ("foobar2" 4))
           nil t "fo")

          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following appears in the minibuffer:
          
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          Complete a foo: fo-!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

     If the user then types `DEL DEL b RET', `completing-read' returns
     `barfoo'.

     The `completing-read' function binds three variables to pass
     information to the commands that actually do completion.  These
     variables are `minibuffer-completion-table',
     `minibuffer-completion-predicate' and
     `minibuffer-completion-confirm'.  For more information about them,
     see *Note Completion Commands::.

Minibuffer Commands That Do Completion
--------------------------------------

   This section describes the keymaps, commands and user options used in
the minibuffer to do completion.

 - Variable: minibuffer-local-completion-map
     `completing-read' uses this value as the local keymap when an
     exact match of one of the completions is not required.  By
     default, this keymap makes the following bindings:

    `?'
          `minibuffer-completion-help'

    SPC
          `minibuffer-complete-word'

    TAB
          `minibuffer-complete'

     with other characters bound as in `minibuffer-local-map' (*note
     Text from Minibuffer::.).

 - Variable: minibuffer-local-must-match-map
     `completing-read' uses this value as the local keymap when an
     exact match of one of the completions is required.  Therefore, no
     keys are bound to `exit-minibuffer', the command that exits the
     minibuffer unconditionally.  By default, this keymap makes the
     following bindings:

    `?'
          `minibuffer-completion-help'

    SPC
          `minibuffer-complete-word'

    TAB
          `minibuffer-complete'

    LFD
          `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'

    RET
          `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'

     with other characters bound as in `minibuffer-local-map'.

 - Variable: minibuffer-completion-table
     The value of this variable is the alist or obarray used for
     completion in the minibuffer.  This is the global variable that
     contains what `completing-read' passes to `try-completion'.  It is
     used by minibuffer completion commands such as
     `minibuffer-complete-word'.

 - Variable: minibuffer-completion-predicate
     This variable's value is the predicate that `completing-read'
     passes to `try-completion'.  The variable is also used by the other
     minibuffer completion functions.

 - Command: minibuffer-complete-word
     This function completes the minibuffer contents by at most a single
     word.  Even if the minibuffer contents have only one completion,
     `minibuffer-complete-word' does not add any characters beyond the
     first character that is not a word constituent.  *Note Syntax
     Tables::.

 - Command: minibuffer-complete
     This function completes the minibuffer contents as far as possible.

 - Command: minibuffer-complete-and-exit
     This function completes the minibuffer contents, and exits if
     confirmation is not required, i.e., if
     `minibuffer-completion-confirm' is non-`nil'.  If confirmation
     *is* required, it is given by repeating this command
     immediately--the command is programmed to work without confirmation
     when run twice in succession.

 - Variable: minibuffer-completion-confirm
     When the value of this variable is non-`nil', Emacs asks for
     confirmation of a completion before exiting the minibuffer.  The
     function `minibuffer-complete-and-exit' checks the value of this
     variable before it exits.

 - Command: minibuffer-completion-help
     This function creates a list of the possible completions of the
     current minibuffer contents.  It works by calling `all-completions'
     using the value of the variable `minibuffer-completion-table' as
     the COLLECTION argument, and the value of
     `minibuffer-completion-predicate' as the PREDICATE argument.  The
     list of completions is displayed as text in a buffer named
     `*Completions*'.

 - Function: display-completion-list COMPLETIONS
     This function displays COMPLETIONS to the stream in
     `standard-output', usually a buffer.  (*Note Read and Print::, for
     more information about streams.)  The argument COMPLETIONS is
     normally a list of completions just returned by `all-completions',
     but it does not have to be.  Each element may be a symbol or a
     string, either of which is simply printed, or a list of two
     strings, which is printed as if the strings were concatenated.

     This function is called by `minibuffer-completion-help'.  The most
     common way to use it is together with
     `with-output-to-temp-buffer', like this:

          (with-output-to-temp-buffer "*Completions*"
            (display-completion-list
              (all-completions (buffer-string) my-alist)))

 - User Option: completion-auto-help
     If this variable is non-`nil', the completion commands
     automatically display a list of possible completions whenever
     nothing can be completed because the next character is not
     uniquely determined.

High-Level Completion  Functions
--------------------------------

   This section describes the higher-level convenient functions for
reading certain sorts of names with completion.

 - Function: read-buffer PROMPT &optional DEFAULT EXISTING
     This function reads the name of a buffer and returns it as a
     string.  The argument DEFAULT is the default name to use, the
     value to return if the user exits with an empty minibuffer.  If
     non-`nil', it should be a string or a buffer.  It is mentioned in
     the prompt, but is not inserted in the minibuffer as initial input.

     If EXISTING is non-`nil', then the name specified must be that of
     an existing buffer.  The usual commands to exit the minibuffer do
     not exit if the text is not valid, and RET does completion to
     attempt to find a valid name.  (However, DEFAULT is not checked
     for validity; it is returned, whatever it is, if the user exits
     with the minibuffer empty.)

     In the following example, the user enters `minibuffer.t', and then
     types RET.  The argument EXISTING is `t', and the only buffer name
     starting with the given input is `minibuffer.texi', so that name
     is the value.

          (read-buffer "Buffer name? " "foo" t)
          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following prompt appears,
          ;;   with an empty minibuffer:
          
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          Buffer name? (default foo) -!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          
          ;; The user types `minibuffer.t RET'.
               => "minibuffer.texi"

 - Function: read-command PROMPT
     This function reads the name of a command and returns it as a Lisp
     symbol.  The argument PROMPT is used as in `read-from-minibuffer'.
     Recall that a command is anything for which `commandp' returns
     `t', and a command name is a symbol for which `commandp' returns
     `t'.  *Note Interactive Call::.

          (read-command "Command name? ")
          
          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following prompt appears with an empty minibuffer:
          
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          Command name?
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

     If the user types `forward-c RET', then this function returns
     `forward-char'.

     The `read-command' function is a simplified interface to the
     function `completing-read'.  It uses the variable `obarray' so as
     to complete in the set of extant Lisp symbols, and it uses the
     `commandp' predicate so as to accept only command names:

          (read-command PROMPT)
          ==
          (intern (completing-read PROMPT obarray
                                   'commandp t nil))

 - Function: read-variable PROMPT
     This function reads the name of a user variable and returns it as a
     symbol.

          (read-variable "Variable name? ")
          
          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following prompt appears,
          ;;   with an empty minibuffer:
          
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          Variable name? -!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

     If the user then types `fill-p RET', `read-variable' returns
     `fill-prefix'.

     This function is similar to `read-command', but uses the predicate
     `user-variable-p' instead of `commandp':

          (read-variable PROMPT)
          ==
          (intern
           (completing-read PROMPT obarray
                            'user-variable-p t nil))

Reading File Names
------------------

   Here is another high-level completion function, designed for reading
a file name.  It provides special features including automatic insertion
of the default directory.

 - Function: read-file-name PROMPT &optional DIRECTORY DEFAULT EXISTING
          INITIAL
     This function reads a file name in the minibuffer, prompting with
     PROMPT and providing completion.  If DEFAULT is non-`nil', then
     the function returns DEFAULT if the user just types RET.  DEFAULT
     is not checked for validity; it is returned, whatever it is, if
     the user exits with the minibuffer empty.

     If EXISTING is non-`nil', then the user must specify the name of
     an existing file; RET performs completion to make the name valid
     if possible, and then refuses to exit if it is not valid.  If the
     value of EXISTING is neither `nil' nor `t', then RET also requires
     confirmation after completion.  If EXISTING is `nil', then the
     name of a nonexistent file is acceptable.

     The argument DIRECTORY specifies the directory to use for
     completion of relative file names.  If `insert-default-directory'
     is non-`nil', DIRECTORY is also inserted in the minibuffer as
     initial input.  It defaults to the current buffer's value of
     `default-directory'.

     If you specify INITIAL, that is an initial file name to insert in
     the buffer (after with DIRECTORY, if that is inserted).  In this
     case, point goes at the beginning of INITIAL.  The default for
     INITIAL is `nil'--don't insert any file name.  To see what INITIAL
     does, try the command `C-x C-v'.

     Here is an example:

          (read-file-name "The file is ")
          
          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following appears in the minibuffer:
          
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          The file is /gp/gnu/elisp/-!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

     Typing `manual TAB' results in the following:

          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          The file is /gp/gnu/elisp/manual.texi-!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------

     If the user types RET, `read-file-name' returns the file name as
     the string `"/gp/gnu/elisp/manual.texi"'.

 - User Option: insert-default-directory
     This variable is used by `read-file-name'.  Its value controls
     whether `read-file-name' starts by placing the name of the default
     directory in the minibuffer, plus the initial file name if any.
     If the value of this variable is `nil', then `read-file-name' does
     not place any initial input in the minibuffer.  In that case, the
     default directory is still used for completion of relative file
     names, but is not displayed.

     For example:

          ;; Here the minibuffer starts out with the default directory.
          (let ((insert-default-directory t))
            (read-file-name "The file is "))
          
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          The file is ~lewis/manual/-!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          
          ;; Here the minibuffer is empty and only the prompt
          ;;   appears on its line.
          (let ((insert-default-directory nil))
            (read-file-name "The file is "))
          
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          The file is -!-
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------


File: elisp,  Node: Programmed Completion,  Prev: Reading File Names,  Up: Completion

Programmed Completion
---------------------

   Sometimes it is not possible to create an alist or an obarray
containing all the intended possible completions.  In such a case, you
can supply your own function to compute the completion of a given
string.  This is called "programmed completion".

   To use this feature, pass a symbol with a function definition as the
COLLECTION argument to `completing-read'.  The function
`completing-read' arranges to pass your completion function along to
`try-completion' and `all-completions', which will then let your
function do all the work.

   The completion function should accept three arguments:

   * The string to be completed.

   * The predicate function to filter possible matches, or `nil' if
     none.  Your function should call the predicate for each possible
     match, and ignore the possible match if the predicate returns
     `nil'.

   * A flag specifying the type of operation.

   There are three flag values for three operations:

   * `nil' specifies `try-completion'.  The completion function should
     return the completion of the specified string, or `t' if the
     string is an exact match already, or `nil' if the string matches no
     possibility.

   * `t' specifies `all-completions'.  The completion function should
     return a list of all possible completions of the specified string.

   * `lambda' specifies a test for an exact match.  The completion
     function should return `t' if the specified string is an exact
     match for some possibility; `nil' otherwise.

   It would be consistent and clean for completion functions to allow
lambda expressions (lists tha are functions) as well as function
symbols as COLLECTION, but this is impossible.  Lists as completion
tables are already assigned another meaning--as alists.  It would be
unreliable to fail to handle an alist normally because it is also a
possible function.  So you must arrange for any function you wish to
use for completion to be encapsulated in a symbol.

   Emacs uses programmed completion when completing file names.  *Note
File Name Completion::.


File: elisp,  Node: Yes-or-No Queries,  Next: Multiple Queries,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Minibuffers

Yes-or-No Queries
=================

   This section describes functions used to ask the user a yes-or-no
question.  The function `y-or-n-p' can be answered with a single
character; it is useful for questions where an inadvertent wrong answer
will not have serious consequences.  `yes-or-no-p' is suitable for more
momentous questions, since it requires three or four characters to
answer.

   If either of these functions is called in a command that was invoked
using the mouse--more precisely, if `last-nonmenu-event' (*note Command
Loop Info::.) is either `nil' or a list--then it uses a dialog box or
pop-up menu to ask the question.  Otherwise, it uses keyboard input.
You can force use of the mouse or use of keyboard input by binding
`last-nonmenu-event' to a suitable value around the call.

   Strictly speaking, `yes-or-no-p' uses the minibuffer and `y-or-n-p'
does not; but it seems best to describe them together.

 - Function: y-or-n-p PROMPT
     This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the echo
     area.  It returns `t' if the user types `y', `nil' if the user
     types `n'.  This function also accepts SPC to mean yes and DEL to
     mean no.  It accepts `C-]' to mean "quit", like `C-g', because the
     question might look like a minibuffer and for that reason the user
     might try to use `C-]' to get out.  The answer is a single
     character, with no RET needed to terminate it.  Upper and lower
     case are equivalent.

     "Asking the question" means printing PROMPT in the echo area,
     followed by the string `(y or n) '.  If the input is not one of
     the expected answers (`y', `n', `SPC', `DEL', or something that
     quits), the function responds `Please answer y or n.', and repeats
     the request.

     This function does not actually use the minibuffer, since it does
     not allow editing of the answer.  It actually uses the echo area
     (*note The Echo Area::.), which uses the same screen space as the
     minibuffer.  The cursor moves to the echo area while the question
     is being asked.

     The answers and their meanings, even `y' and `n', are not
     hardwired.  The keymap `query-replace-map' specifies them.  *Note
     Search and Replace::.

     In the following example, the user first types `q', which is
     invalid.  At the next prompt the user types `y'.

          (y-or-n-p "Do you need a lift? ")
          
          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following prompt appears in the echo area:

          ---------- Echo area ----------
          Do you need a lift? (y or n)
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          
          ;; If the user then types `q', the following appears:
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          Please answer y or n.  Do you need a lift? (y or n)
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          
          ;; When the user types a valid answer,
          ;;   it is displayed after the question:
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          Do you need a lift? (y or n) y
          ---------- Echo area ----------

     We show successive lines of echo area messages, but only one
     actually appears on the screen at a time.

 - Function: yes-or-no-p PROMPT
     This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the
     minibuffer.  It returns `t' if the user enters `yes', `nil' if the
     user types `no'.  The user must type RET to finalize the response.
     Upper and lower case are equivalent.

     `yes-or-no-p' starts by displaying PROMPT in the echo area,
     followed by `(yes or no) '.  The user must type one of the
     expected responses; otherwise, the function responds `Please answer
     yes or no.', waits about two seconds and repeats the request.

     `yes-or-no-p' requires more work from the user than `y-or-n-p' and
     is appropriate for more crucial decisions.

     Here is an example:

          (yes-or-no-p "Do you really want to remove everything? ")
          
          ;; After evaluation of the preceding expression,
          ;;   the following prompt appears,
          ;;   with an empty minibuffer:

          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
          Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------

     If the user first types `y RET', which is invalid because this
     function demands the entire word `yes', it responds by displaying
     these prompts, with a brief pause between them:

          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
          Please answer yes or no.
          Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------

Asking Multiple Y-or-N Questions
================================

   When you have a series of similar questions to ask, such as "Do you
want to save this buffer" for each buffer in turn, you should use
`map-y-or-n-p' to ask the collection of questions, rather than asking
each question individually.  This gives the user certain convenient
facilities such as the ability to answer the whole series at once.

 - Function: map-y-or-n-p PROMPTER ACTOR LIST &optional HELP
          ACTION-ALIST
     This function, new in Emacs 19, asks the user a series of
     questions, reading a single-character answer in the echo area for
     each one.

     The value of LIST specifies the objects to ask questions about.
     It should be either a list of objects or a generator function.  If
     it is a function, it should expect no arguments, and should return
     either the next object to ask about, or `nil' meaning stop asking
     questions.

     The argument PROMPTER specifies how to ask each question.  If
     PROMPTER is a string, the question text is computed like this:

          (format PROMPTER OBJECT)

     where OBJECT is the next object to ask about (as obtained from
     LIST).

     If not a string, PROMPTER should be a function of one argument
     (the next object to ask about) and should return the question text.

     The argument ACTOR says how to act on the answers that the user
     gives.  It should be a function of one argument, and it is called
     with each object that the user says yes for.  Its argument is
     always an object obtained from LIST.

     If the argument HELP is given, it should be a list of this form:

          (SINGULAR PLURAL ACTION)

     where SINGULAR is a string containing a singular noun that
     describes the objects conceptually being acted on, PLURAL is the
     corresponding plural noun, and ACTION is a transitive verb
     describing what ACTOR does.

     If you don't specify HELP, the default is `("object" "objects"
     "act on")'.

     Each time a question is asked, the user may enter `y', `Y', or SPC
     to act on that object; `n', `N', or DEL to skip that object; `!'
     to act on all following objects; ESC or `q' to exit (skip all
     following objects); `.' (period) to act on the current object and
     then exit; or `C-h' to get help.  These are the same answers that
     `query-replace' accepts.  The keymap `query-replace-map' defines
     their meaning for `map-y-or-n-p' as well as for `query-replace';
     see *Note Search and Replace::.

     You can use ACTION-ALIST to specify additional possible answers
     and what they mean.  It is an alist of elements of the form `(CHAR
     FUNCTION HELP)', each of which defines one additional answer.  In
     this element, CHAR is a character (the answer); FUNCTION is a
     function of one argument (an object from LIST); HELP is a string.

     When the user responds with CHAR, `map-y-or-n-p' calls FUNCTION.
     If it returns non-`nil', the object is considered "acted upon",
     and `map-y-or-n-p' advances to the next object in LIST.  If it
     returns `nil', the prompt is repeated for the same object.

     If `map-y-or-n-p' is called in a command that was invoked using the
     mouse--more precisely, if `last-nonmenu-event' (*note Command Loop
     Info::.) is either `nil' or a list--then it uses a dialog box or
     pop-up menu to ask the question.  In this case, it does not use
     keyboard input or the echo area.  You can force use of the mouse
     or use of keyboard input by binding `last-nonmenu-event' to a
     suitable value around the call.

     The return value of `map-y-or-n-p' is the number of objects acted
     on.

Minibuffer Miscellany
=====================

   This section describes some basic functions and variables related to
minibuffers.

 - Command: exit-minibuffer
     This command exits the active minibuffer.  It is normally bound to
     keys in minibuffer local keymaps.

 - Command: self-insert-and-exit
     This command exits the active minibuffer after inserting the last
     character typed on the keyboard (found in `last-command-char';
     *note Command Loop Info::.).

 - Command: previous-history-element N
     This command replaces the minibuffer contents with the value of the
     Nth previous (older) history element.

 - Command: next-history-element N
     This command replaces the minibuffer contents with the value of the
     Nth more recent history element.

 - Command: previous-matching-history-element PATTERN
     This command replaces the minibuffer contents with the value of the
     previous (older) history element that matches PATTERN (a regular
     expression).

 - Command: next-matching-history-element PATTERN
     This command replaces the minibuffer contents with the value of
     the next (newer) history element that matches PATTERN (a regular
     expression).

 - Variable: minibuffer-setup-hook
     This is a normal hook that is run whenever the minibuffer is
     entered.  *Note Hooks::.

 - Variable: minibuffer-setup-hook
     This is a normal hook that is run whenever the minibuffer is
     exited.  *Note Hooks::.

 - Variable: minibuffer-help-form
     The current value of this variable is used to rebind `help-form'
     locally inside the minibuffer (*note Help Functions::.).

 - Function: minibuffer-window &optional FRAME
     This function returns the window that is used for the minibuffer.
     In Emacs 18, there is one and only one minibuffer window; this
     window always exists and cannot be deleted.  In Emacs 19, each
     frame can have its own minibuffer, and this function returns the
     minibuffer window used for frame FRAME (which defaults to the
     currently selected frame).

 - Function: window-minibuffer-p WINDOW
     This function returns non-`nil' if WINDOW is a minibuffer window.

   It is not correct to determine whether a given window is a
minibuffer by comparing it with the result of `(minibuffer-window)',
because there can be more than one minibuffer window if there is more
than one frame.

 - Function: minibuffer-window-active-p WINDOW
     This function returns non-`nil' if WINDOW, assumed to be a
     minibuffer window, is currently active.

 - Variable: minibuffer-scroll-window
     If the value of this variable is non-`nil', it should be a window
     object.  When the function `scroll-other-window' is called in the
     minibuffer, it scrolls this window.

   Finally, some functions and variables deal with recursive minibuffers
(*note Recursive Editing::.):

 - Function: minibuffer-depth
     This function returns the current depth of activations of the
     minibuffer, a nonnegative integer.  If no minibuffers are active,
     it returns zero.

 - Function: minibuffer-prompt
     This function returns the prompt string of the currently active
     minibuffer.  If no minibuffer is active, it returns `nil'.

 - Function: minibuffer-prompt-width
     This function returns the display width of the prompt string of the
     currently active minibuffer.  If no minibuffer is active, it
     returns 0.

 - User Option: enable-recursive-minibuffers
     If this variable is non-`nil', you can invoke commands (such as
     `find-file') that use minibuffers even while in the minibuffer
     window.  Such invocation produces a recursive editing level for a
     new minibuffer.  The outer-level minibuffer is invisible while you
     are editing the inner one.

     This variable only affects invoking the minibuffer while the
     minibuffer window is selected.   If you switch windows while in the
     minibuffer, you can always invoke minibuffer commands while some
     other window is selected.

   If a command name has a property `enable-recursive-minibuffers' that
is non-`nil', then the command can use the minibuffer to read arguments
even if it is invoked from the minibuffer.  The minibuffer command
`next-matching-history-element' (normally bound to `M-s' in the
minibuffer) uses this feature.
