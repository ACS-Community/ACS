Projects and other things left to do
************************************

Coming Attractions
==================

   Some things that will probably be available in libg++ in the near
future:

   * Revamped C-compatibility header files that will be compatible with
     the forthcoming (ANSI-based) GNU libc.a

   * A revision of the File-based classes that will use the GNU stdio
     library, and also be 100% compatible (even at the streambuf level)
     with the AT&T 2.0 stream classes.

   * Additional container class prototypes.

   * generic Matrix class prototypes.

   * A task package probably based on Dirk Grunwald's threads package.

Wish List
=========

   Some things that people have mentioned that they would like to see
in libg++, but for which there have not been any offers:

   * A method to automatically convert or incorporate libg++ classes so
     they can be used directly in Gorlen's OOPS environment.

   * A class browser.

   * A better general exception-handling strategy.

   * Better documentation.

How to contribute
=================

   Programmers who have written C++ classes that they believe to be of
general interest are encourage to write to dl at rocky.oswego.edu.
Contributing code is not difficult. Here are some general guidelines:

   * FSF must maintain the right to accept or reject potential
     contributions.  Generally, the only reasons for rejecting
     contributions are cases where they duplicate existing or
     nearly-released code, contain unremovable specific machine
     dependencies, or are somehow incompatible with the rest of the
     library.

   * Acceptance of contributions means that the code is accepted for
     adaptation into libg++.  FSF must reserve the right to make
     various editorial changes in code. Very often, this merely entails
     formatting, maintenance of various conventions, etc. Contributors
     are always given authorship credit and shown the final version for
     approval.

   * Contributors must assign their copyright to FSF via a form sent out
     upon acceptance. Assigning copyright to FSF ensures that the code
     may be freely distributed.

   * Assistance in providing documentation, test files, and debugging
     support is strongly encouraged.

   Extensions, comments, and suggested modifications of existing libg++
features are also very welcome.
