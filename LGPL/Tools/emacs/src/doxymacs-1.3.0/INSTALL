- Put lisp/doxymacs.el and lisp/xml-parse.el somewhere in your {X}Emacs 
  load-path.
- Customise the variables doxymacs-doxygen-root and doxymacs-doxygen-tags.
  Doxymacs customisation can be done from the Options | Customize menu,
  under Emacs | Programming | Tools | Doxymacs.
- If your tags file is quite large (say, > 1 MB), consider setting
  doxymacs-use-external-xml-parser to t and be sure to set
  doxymacs-external-xml-parser-executable to the right value (the
  default should usually be fine).  A suitable program is
  distributed along with this file in the directory doxymacs/c/.
  Edit the Makefile, then type "make", followed by "make install".
  With an 11 MB XML tag file, the internal process takes 20 minutes
  on a PIII 800 with 1 GB of RAM, whereas the external process takes 12
  seconds.
- Put (require 'doxymacs) in your .emacs
- Invoke doxymacs-mode with M-x doxymacs-mode. To have doxymacs-mode invoked
  automatically when in C/C++ mode, put 

  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'doxymacs-mode) 

  in your .emacs.
- If you want Doxygen keywords fontified use M-x doxymacs-font-lock.
  To do it automatically, add the following to your .emacs:

  (defun my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook ()
    (if (or (eq major-mode 'c-mode) (eq major-mode 'c++-mode))
        (doxymacs-font-lock)))
  (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook 'my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook)

  This will add the Doxygen keywords to c-mode and c++-mode only.
- Default key bindings are:
  - C-c d ? will look up documentation for the symbol under the point.
  - C-c d r will rescan your Doxygen tags file.
  - C-c d f will insert a Doxygen comment for the next function.
  - C-c d i will insert a Doxygen comment for the current file.
  - C-c d ; will insert a Doxygen comment for the current member.
  - C-c d m will insert a blank multiline Doxygen comment.
  - C-c d s will insert a blank singleline Doxygen comment.
  - C-c d @ will insert grouping comments around the current region.

Doxymacs depends on the following packages:

- W3 	http://www.cs.indiana.edu/usr/local/www/elisp/w3/docs.html
- tempo http://www.lysator.liu.se/~davidk/elisp/

The external XML parser requires libxml2 version 2.3.4 or greater and can be
obtained from http://www.libxml.org/.
