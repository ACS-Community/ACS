;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   Speedbar provides a frame in which files, and locations in
;; files are displayed.  These functions provide Info specific support,
;; showing links and addresses in the side-bar.
;;
;;   To enable in Emacs 20.2 or earlier, add this to your .emacs file.
;;   (autoload 'Info-speedbar-buttons "sb-info"
;;             "Info specific speedbar button generator.")
;;
;;   This file requires speedbar and Info.

;;; Change log:
;; 0.1   - first revision copied from speedbspec.el V 0.1.1
;; 0.1.1 - No longer require speedbspec
;; 0.2   - Added a speedbar major mode for displaying Info nodes, and modeled
;;         the minor mode after it.  Completely replaced the old info display
;;         with the major mode, and mixed them to move nicely from major to
;;         minor mode effortlessly.
;; 0.2.1   Added section adding major display mode at load time.
