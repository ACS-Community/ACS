;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   The speedbar provides a frame in which files, and locations in
;; files are displayed.  These items can be clicked on with mouse-2
;; in order to make the last active frame display that file location.
;;
;; Starting Speedbar:
;;
;;   If speedbar came to you as a part of Emacs, simply type
;; `M-x speedbar', and it will be autoloaded for you.
;;
;;   If speedbar is not a part of your distribution, then add
;; this to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'speedbar-frame-mode "speedbar" "Popup a speedbar frame" t)
;;   (autoload 'speedbar-get-focus "speedbar" "Jump to speedbar frame" t)
;;
;;   If you want to choose it from a menu, such as "Tools", you can do this:
;;
;;   Emacs:
;;   (define-key-after (lookup-key global-map [menu-bar tools])
;;      [speedbar] '("Speedbar" . speedbar-frame-mode) [calendar])
;;
;;   XEmacs:
;;   (add-menu-button '("Tools")
;;		      ["Speedbar" speedbar-frame-mode
;;		       :style toggle
;;		       :selected (and (boundp 'speedbar-frame)
;;				      (frame-live-p speedbar-frame)
;;				      (frame-visible-p speedbar-frame))]
;;		      "--")
;;
;;   If you want to access speedbar using only the keyboard, do this:
;;
;;   (global-set-key [(f4)] 'speedbar-get-focus)
;;
;;   This will let you hit f4 (or whatever key you choose) to jump
;; focus to the speedbar frame.  Pressing it again will bring you back
;; to the attached frame.  Pressing RET or e to jump to a file
;; or tag will move you back to the attached frame.  The command
;; `speedbar-get-focus' will also create a speedbar frame if it does
;; not exist.
;;
;; Customizing Speedbar:
;;
;;   Once a speedbar frame is active, it takes advantage of idle time
;; to keep its contents updated.  The contents is usually a list of
;; files in the directory of the currently active buffer.  When
;; applicable, tags in the active file can be expanded.
;;
;;   To add new supported files types into speedbar, use the function
;; `speedbar-add-supported-extension' If speedbar complains that the
;; file type is not supported, that means there is no built in
;; support from imenu, and the etags part wasn't set up correctly.  You
;; may add elements to `speedbar-supported-extension-expressions' as long
;; as it is done before speedbar is loaded.
;;
;;   To prevent speedbar from following you into certain directories
;; use the function `speedbar-add-ignored-path-regexp' too add a new
;; regular expression matching a type of path.  You may add list
;; elements to `speedbar-ignored-path-expressions' as long as it is
;; done before speedbar is loaded.
;;
;;   To add new file types to imenu, see the documentation in the
;; file imenu.el that comes with Emacs.  To add new file types which
;; etags supports, you need to modify the variable
;; `speedbar-fetch-etags-parse-list'.
;;
;;    If the updates are going too slow for you, modify the variable
;; `speedbar-update-speed' to a longer idle time before updates.
;;
;;    If you navigate directories, you will probably notice that you
;; will navigate to a directory which is eventually replaced after
;; you go back to editing a file (unless you pull up a new file.)
;; The delay time before this happens is in
;; `speedbar-navigating-speed', and defaults to 10 seconds.
;;
;;    To enable mouse tracking with information in the minibuffer of
;; the attached frame, use the variable `speedbar-track-mouse-flag'.
;;
;;    Tag layout can be modified through `speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method',
;; which controls how tags are layed out.  It is actually a list of
;; functions that filter the data.  The default groups large tag lists
;; into sub-lists.  A long flat list can be used instead if needed.
;; Other filters could be easily added.
;;
;;    Users of XEmacs previous to 20 may want to change the default
;; timeouts for `speedbar-update-speed' to something longer as XEmacs
;; doesn't have idle timers, the speedbar timer keeps going off
;; arbitrarily while you're typing.  It's quite pesky.
;;
;;    Users of really old emacsen without the needed timers will not
;; have speedbar updating automatically.  Use "r" to refresh the
;; display after changing directories.  Remember, do not interrupt the
;; stealthy updates or your display may not be completely refreshed.
;;
;;    AUC-TEX users: The imenu tags for AUC-TEX mode don't work very
;; well.  Use the imenu keywords from tex-mode.el for better results.
;;
;; This file requires the library package assoc (association lists)
;; and the package custom (for easy configuration of speedbar)
;;     http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/
;;
;;; Developing for speedbar
;;
;; Adding a speedbar specialized display mode:
;;
;; Speedbar can be configured to create a special display for certain
;; modes that do not display tradition file/tag data.  Rmail, Info,
;; and the debugger are examples.  These modes can, however, benefit
;; from a speedbar style display in their own way.
;;
;; If your `major-mode' is `foo-mode', the only requirement is to
;; create a function called `foo-speedbar-buttons' which takes one
;; argument, BUFFER.  BUFFER will be the buffer speedbar wants filled.
;; In `foo-speedbar-buttons' there are several functions that make
;; building a speedbar display easy.  See the documentation for
;; `speedbar-with-writable' (needed because the buffer is usually
;; read-only) `speedbar-make-tag-line', `speedbar-insert-button', and
;; `speedbar-insert-generic-list'.  If you use
;; `speedbar-insert-generic-list', also read the doc for
;; `speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method' in case you wish to override it.
;; The function `speedbar-with-attached-buffer' brings you back to the
;; buffer speedbar is displaying for.
;;
;; For those functions that make buttons, the "function" should be a
;; symbol that is the function to call when clicked on.  The "token"
;; is extra data you can pass along.  The "function" must take three
;; parameters.  They are (TEXT TOKEN INDENT).  TEXT is the text of the
;; button clicked on.  TOKEN is the data passed in when you create the
;; button.  INDENT is an indentation level, or 0.  You can store
;; indentation levels with `speedbar-make-tag-line' which creates a
;; line with an expander (eg.  [+]) and a text button.
;;
;; Some useful functions when writing expand functions, and click
;; functions are `speedbar-change-expand-button-char',
;; `speedbar-delete-subblock', and `speedbar-center-buffer-smartly'.
;; The variable `speedbar-power-click' is set to t in your functions
;; when the user shift-clicks.  This indications anything from
;; refreshing cached data to making a buffer appear in a new frame.
;;
;; If you wish to add to the default speedbar menu for the case of
;; `foo-mode', create a variable `foo-speedbar-menu-items'.  This
;; should be a list compatible with the `easymenu' package.  It will
;; be spliced into the main menu.  (Available with click-mouse-3).  If
;; you wish to have extra key bindings in your special mode, create a
;; variable `foo-speedbar-key-map'.  Instead of using `make-keymap',
;; or `make-sparse-keymap', use the function
;; `speedbar-make-specialized-keymap'.  This lets you inherit all of
;; speedbar's default bindings with low overhead.
;;
;; Adding a speedbar top-level display mode:
;;
;; Unlike the specialized modes, there are no name requirements,
;; however the methods for writing a button display, menu, and keymap
;; are the same.  Once you create these items, you can call the
;; function `speedbar-add-expansion-list'.  It takes one parameter
;; which is a list element of the form (NAME MENU KEYMAP &rest
;; BUTTON-FUNCTIONS).  NAME is a string that will show up in the
;; Displays menu item.  MENU is a symbol containing the menu items to
;; splice in.  KEYMAP is a symbol holding the keymap to use, and
;; BUTTON-FUNCTIONS are the function names to call, in order, to create
;; the display.

;;; TODO:
;; - More functions to create buttons and options
;; - Timeout directories we haven't visited in a while.
;; - Remeber tags when refreshing the display.  (Refresh tags too?)
;; - More 'special mode support.

\\<speedbar-key-map>
The first line represents the default path of the speedbar frame.
Each directory segment is a button which jumps speedbar's default
directory to that path.  Buttons are activated by clicking `\\[speedbar-click]'.
In some situations using `\\[speedbar-power-click]' is a `power click' which will
rescan cached items, or pop up new frames.

Each line starting with <+> represents a directory.  Click on the <+>
to insert the directory listing into the current tree.  Click on the
<-> to retract that list.  Click on the directory name to go to that
directory as the default.

Each line starting with [+] is a file.  If the variable
`speedbar-show-unknown-files' is t, the lines starting with [?] are
files which don't have imenu support, but are not expressly ignored.
Files are completely ignored if they match `speedbar-file-unshown-regexp'
which is generated from `completion-ignored-extensions'.

Files with a `*' character after their name are files checked out of a
version control system.  (currently only RCS is supported.)  New
version control systems can be added by examining the documentation
for `speedbar-this-file-in-vc' and `speedbar-vc-check-dir-p'

Files with a `#' or `!' character after them are source files that
have an object file associated with them.  The `!' indicates that the
files is out of date.   You can control what source/object associations
exist through the variable `speedbar-obj-alist'.

Click on the [+] to display a list of tags from that file.  Click on
the [-] to retract the list.  Click on the file name to edit the file
in the attached frame.

If you open tags, you might find a node starting with {+}, which is a
category of tags.  Click the {+} to expand the category.  Jump-able
tags start with >.  Click the name of the tag to go to that position
in the selected file.
