2001-11-26  William M. Perry  <wmperry@gnu.org>

	* build-dist: Deal with new branch

	* lisp/w3-e21.el: Stub for emacs 21

	* lisp/docomp.el: Avoid setting up a bunch of variables that
	confuse emacs21 later.  This fixes the keymapp nil error during
	byte compilation.  Side effect is that it causes lots of warnings
	in mule-sysdp.el and a few other files.

	* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-pause): Emacs21 work.

1999-11-14  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* aclocal.m4 (AC_EMACS_LISP): work around bug in current Emacs 21.1
  pretests where (princ "foo") crashes in batch mode.

1999-11-13  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-cus.el (w3-use-terminal-glyphs): Changed default value to nil,
  was causing too many weirdnesses under Emacs (I loathe MULE sometimes)
  (w3-use-terminal-characters): Ditto.

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-java): Duh, give 2 arguments to
  push.

1999-11-12  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-java): Make sure that there is
  ALWAYS a codebase attribute for java, or bad things could happen (like
  not being able to find the classes since we write to a temp file, etc.)

* lisp/w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Make sure that we expand the
  'codebase' attribute.

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-auto-run-java): New variable to control whether
  Java applets are run 
  (w3-display-handle-java): New function to convert our internal parse
  structure into something that `w3-java-run-applet' can understand.
  (w3-display-node): Use it.

* lisp/w3-java.el: New file for running java programs in an external
  process.

1999-11-07  Markus Rost  <markus.rost@mathematik.uni-regensburg.de>

* lisp/url.el (url-retrieve-internally): make-local-variable
  'track-mouse to workaround problem with `widget-button-click'.

1999-11-10  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  XCDATA so that markup can be included in the default text.

* lisp/w3-menu.el (w3-menu-help-menu): Remove version information menu
  item.  It hasn't been updated in years.

1999-11-10  "T. V. Raman" <raman@cs.cornell.edu>

* lisp/w3-display.el (widget-convert-text): Added advice around this
  function to preserve the 'personality' text property, otherwise
  hyperlinks did not get the correct aural properties applied.

1999-11-10  Thierry Emery <Thierry.Emery@nmu.alcatel.fr>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-maybe-start-image-download): typo.
  (w3-handle-image): include row and column in hyperimage-info, to be used
  in `w3-resurrect-images'.
  (w3-resurrect-images): if `to-cut' gets negative, insert blanks.
  (w3-display-node): in case of a frameset, checks rows as well.
  (w3-frameset-dimensions-p): disregard anything containing "100%", such as
  "100%,0".
  (w3-display-frameset): Do not zap frameset-cardinal when computing
  default dimensions. Memorize next window before drawing a frame, as its
  HTML page may contain yet another (nested) frameset. Call `w3-warn' and
  inhibit splitting the window when there is not enough room left.

* lisp/mm.el (mm-parse-mailcap): Fix bad regexp for Emacs 21

1999-11-09  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/socks.el (socks-nslookup-host): Make sure that we always call
  accept-process-output at least once.  Now deals correctly with multiple
  addresses returned by nslookup in the format 'Addresses: ip1, ip2, ip3'

1999-11-09  kyota@po.ntts.co.jp (Kyotaro HORIGUCHI)

* lisp/mule-sysdp.el: Patches to understand MULE 4.1

1999-11-09  Alexandre Guimond  <guim@guim.org>

* lisp/w3.el (w3-mail-document-author): Fix problem with 'Reply-To'
  headers.  They had not been converted to the (not quite so) new plist
  format.

1999-10-15  Dave Love  <fx@gnu.org>

* lisp/w3-parse.el (char-int): Alias it to `identity' if necessary.

1999-10-14  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url-ldap.el (url-ldap-certificate-formatter): Now uses
  ssl-certificate-information instead of hacked up bill-specific stuff.

* lisp/ssl.el (ssl-certificate-information): New function to get
  certificate information out of a DER encoded object.
  (ssl-program-name): Default to using OpenSSL now.

1999-10-11  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-fixup-eol-faces): only strip spaces off of
  newlines, not the surrounding shitepsace.  This makes colorized table
  cells look much better.

1999-09-16  Michael Sperber [Mr. Preprocessor]  <sperber@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>

* lisp/url-cache.el: 
* lisp/w3-display.el: 
* lisp/w3.el: Added (require 'url-parse) because of the macros
  defined there.

1999-08-07  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-make-xemacs-menubar): Fixed to work with
  BeOpen.com InfoDock.  Old code allowed multiple 'nil's to creep into the 
  menubar which would cause a hang in the XEmacs menubar code.

1999-08-04  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url-cid.el (url-cid-gnus): Fixed so it will work in Emacs and
  XEmacs 21.2

1999-08-03  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/mule-sysdp.el (mule-sysdep-version): Make
  enable-multibyte-characters buffer-local when in XEmacs, to better mimic 
  the Emacs 20.x behaviour.

1999-07-19  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/images.el (image-register-netpbm-utilities): Fixed typo in the ppm
  to xpm converter.

1999-06-27  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url-parse.el (url-generic-parse-url): Added in gross hack to
  preserve ';' in data URLs.  The usage as a separator for content-type
  and encoding-type clashes horribly with the ';' as an
  attribute-separator on normal URLs.

* lisp/w3-parse.el (w3-parse-hooks): New hook to be run just before
  parsing any document.  This can theoretically be used to rip out banner
  advertisements, etc.
  (w3-parse-munge-ethiopic-text): Moved the old ethiopic munging stuff
  into hook form.

* lisp/url-mail.el (url-mailto): Allow adding of more 'to' headers via the 
  query interface for mailto URLs.  Would generate corrup To: headers
  otherwise.

1999-06-15  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url-ldap.el (url-ldap-attribute-formatters): Format naming contexts 
  as hyperlinks back into the directory.
  (url-ldap-certificate-formatter): Save certificate data to a file.

1999-04-29  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/font.el (font-find-available-family): Fixes for latest version of
  the new Emacs redisplay.

1999-04-08  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs/W3 4.0.43 released

* Fixed the hackmap stuff for Emacs 19/20

1999-04-08  Thierry Emery <Thierry.Emery@nmu.alcatel.fr>

* lisp/url-cookie.el (url-cookie-write-file): check
  `url-cookies-changed-since-last-save' and that the file is writable.
  (url-cookie-handle-set-cookie): set `url-cookies-changed-since-last-save'.

* lisp/url-http.el (url-create-mime-request): Moved Proxy Authorization up
  (before Cookie and Authorization).

* lisp/url-vars.el (url-cookies-changed-since-last-save): new variable.

* lisp/url.el (url-write-global-history): call `url-cookie-write-file' if
  `url-privacy-level' tolerates cookies.

1999-04-08  Thierry Emery <Thierry.Emery@nmu.alcatel.fr>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-resurrect-images): corrected regexp for
  removing trailing blanks from alt.

1999-04-05  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-forms.el (w3-form-keymap): Ditto for form fields.

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-resurrect-hyperlinks): Hack around lossage in
  XEmacs' Widget package.  button3 was used to activate the widget instead
  of popping up a context-sensitive menu like everywhere else.

1999-04-03  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-display.el: Make sure we load mule-sysdp at compile time.

1999-04-03  Thierry Emery  <Thierry.Emery@nmu.alcatel.fr>

* lisp/url-file.el (inline): require `w3-sysdp', necessary for
  `add-minor-mode' in Gnu Emacs when Emacs-W3 is autoloaded through
  `url-dired-find-file'.
  (url-insert-possibly-compressed-file): set `url-current-mime-encoding'.
  (url-dired-find-file): handle ange-ftp dired.
  (url-file-asynch-callback, url-file): call
  `url-insert-possibly-compressed-file' instead of
  `insert-file-contents-literally'.
  (url-file): compute `url-current-mime-type' and `viewer' from
  `uncompressed-filename'; specify extension for
  `mm-generate-unique-filename'.

* lisp/url.el (url-file-directly-accessible-p): call
  `url-host-is-local-p' and check that the file is not compressed.
  (url-generate-unique-filename-counter): new variable.
  (url-generate-unique-filename): use
  `url-generate-unique-filename-counter' to ensure that filenames are
  unique within an Emacs session.

1999-04-03  Thierry Emery  <Thierry.Emery@nmu.alcatel.fr>

* lisp/url.el (url-write-global-history): call
  `w3-write-explicit-encodings'.

* lisp/w3-cus.el (w3-explicit-encodings-file): new user option, which
  specifies where to save `w3-explicit-conversion-tree'.

* lisp/w3-vars.el: new variables
  w3-explicit-conversion-tree: Tree to hold explicit coding systems
  for URLs and their superdirs:
  ((hostN default-coding (dirN-1 default-coding (dirN-1-1 ...) ...) ...)
    ...),
  w3-explicit-encodings-changed-since-last-save: whether
  `w3-explicit-conversion-tree' needs saving.

* lisp/w3.el:
  w3-convert-code-for-mule: call `w3-recall-explicit-coding-system'
  after checking `w3-explicit-coding-system' and `mmcharset'.
  w3-reload-document: call `w3-record-explicit-coding-system'.
  w3-recall-explicit-coding-system, w3-find-explicit-coding-system,
  w3-record-explicit-coding-system, w3-add-explicit-coding-system,
  w3-write-explicit-encodings: new functions to perform retrieval and
  storage of user-specified (through C-u g `w3-reload-document')
  explicit coding systems.
  w3-do-setup: load `w3-explicit-encodings-file' if it exists.

1999-03-24  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs/W3 4.0.40 released

* lisp/url.el (url-do-setup): Always register the LDAP URL format.

* lisp/url-ldap.el (url-ldap): Deal with non-LDAP enabled emacsen better.

1999-03-22  Markus Rost <markus.rost@mathematik.uni-regensburg.de>

* lisp/w3.el (w3-fetch): Gracefully accept 'nil' as the URL.

1999-03-22  Martin Schwenke <Martin.Schwenke@cs.anu.edu.au>

* lisp/w3-sysdp.el (frame-parameter): This was not defined in 19.34.

1999-03-19  William Perry <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Make sure we restore the old syntax
  table when we are done parsing.

1999-03-18  Kenichi Handa <handa@etl.go.jp>

* lisp/w3.el (w3-viewer-filter): Do not create the 'output' buffer if the
  length of the string received by the filter is 0.  Evidently solaris
  sends an empty string to the filter when the process exits.

1999-03-18  "T. V. Raman" <raman@adobe.com>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-widget-echo): Use buffer-substring --rather than
  buffer-substring-no-properties when picking out the text under the
  current link. 

  This is good for emacspeak because you can then tell while
  tabbing through a  page whether the link you just hit has
  been visited.

1999-01-08  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/docomp.el (emacs-build-autoloads): Only do the autoloads one way
  for Emacs or XEmacs.

1999-01-07  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* build.bat: More tweaking of finding EMACSDIR automatically.

* lisp/w3-vars.el (w3-mode-map): Don't use read-kbd-macro

1999-01-05  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* build.bat: Make sure that we build the autoload files under windows.
  Easier setting of the environment variables.  Also can now pass in
  EMACSDIR on the command line.

* lisp/docomp.el (byte-compile-dest-file): Downcase file names if we are
  in windows of any flavor.  Sometimes we get foo.EL instead of foo.el and 
  we were just naming the output file foo.EL.elc
  (compile-it): Make sure we get *.EL from directory-files as well.
  (emacs-build-autoloads): Ditto.  %!@!ing windows file systems.
  (emacs-build-autoloads): Deal with Emacs or XEmacs way of rebuilding
  autoloads in lisp instead of relying on autoconf.  This will make
  everything much happier under windows.

1999-01-04  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Makefile.in (dotemacs): Wrap the require we stick into $(DOTEMACS) in a
  `condition-case' for people that share their setups between emacsen or
  machines with different installed packages.

* lisp/w3-forms.el (w3-form-encode-xwfu): Don't forget to deal with the
  new attributes if we are doing just a plain old form submission!

1999-01-04  Milan Zamazal <pdm@freesoft.cz>

* lisp/w3-forms.el (w3-submit-form): Correctly shorten the separator
  generated... was including too few characters.
  (w3-form-encode-helper): Added ability to specify additional attributes
  for the `file' input type so that we can keep track of the filename.
  (w3-form-encode-make-mime-part): Create content-disposition header
  instead of content-id and content-length
  (w3-form-encode-multipart/x-www-form-data): Use CRLF instead of just LF
  for separators.
  (w3-form-encode-multipart/x-www-form-data): Don't forget to add in the
  separator at the end of the message.

1998-01-04  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-forms.el (w3-form-encode-multipart/x-www-form-data): Better
  separator generation.

1999-01-04  Laurent Martelli <martelli@iie.cnam.fr>

* lisp/w3-hotindex.el: Added autoload statements.

1999-01-04  Kenichi Handa  <handa@etl.go.jp>

* lisp/Makefile.in (w3-auto.el): Generate w3-auto.el from
  auto-autoloads.el just build in the current directory.

1998-12-31  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/font.el: Various mergings with the XEmacs distributed version of
  font.el.  Lots of byte-compile warnings squashed when not building with
  Emacs/W3.

1998-12-31  Jonathan Harris  <jhar@tardis.ed.ac.uk>

* font.el: Split font-family-mappings into X and mswindows-specific
  versions.  mswindows-font-create-[object|name]: Treat supplied size as a
  pointsize. Added underline and strikethru handling.

1998-12-30  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url.el (url-file-exists): If url-user is nil use anonymous ftp.
  (url-file-size): Ditto.

* lisp/w3.el (w3-find-this-file): Protect against sticking 'nil@' in the
  filename spec when we go to retrieve something.

1998-12-30  Milan Zamazal <pdm@pvt.net>

* lisp/url-auth.el (url-basic-auth): Make sure to use base64-encode-string 
  instead of base64-encode to work with new Emacs/XEmacs that have native
  base64 encoding/decoding primitives.

1998-12-29  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre38 released

* lisp/url.el (url-file-attributes): use 'anonymous' instead of 'ftp' as
  the username if none specified.

1998-12-29  Markus Rost  <markus.rost@mathematik.uni-regensburg.de>

* url.el (url-file-attributes): If url-user is nil use anonymous ftp.

1998-12-29  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/mule-sysdp.el (mule-detect-coding-version): Doh - make sure we
  don't blow up in XEmacs w/Mule when making sure we have a valid coding
  system.

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre37 released
	
* lisp/socks.el (socks-find-route): Fixed bug where we would not honor the
  '!' at the front of the regexp to mean _do_ redirect the connection.  I
  need to finish the socks-redirection-rules stuff sometime soon.

* lisp/mule-sysdp.el (mule-detect-coding-version): Put back in the
  ultra-anal checks to make sure that what detect-coding-region and
  friends find is actually a coding system.  Apparently the bug where
  bizarre combinations of CRLF and LF separators in a file make Emacs 20.3
  return a number as a coding system is back.  Bug reported to the Emacs
  maintainers.

1998-12-28  Milan Zamazal <pdm@freesoft.cz>

* lisp/mm.el (mm-possible-viewers): Don't reverse exact & wildcard when
  concatenating them.  Reason: `mm-mime-data' contains mailcap entries in
  the opposite order than they are in the mailcap file.  The function
  `mm-possible-viewers' should return found items in the opposite order
  again, so that the first viewer from the mailcap was invoked.  The patch
  ensures this.

* lisp/mm.el (mm-mime-data-default): New variable that holds all the
  defaults.  mm-mime-data now holds _only_ the user supplied viewers.

* lisp/mm.el (mm-mime-info): Give preference to things found in
  mm-mime-data (the user stuff) and then fall back onto
  mm-mime-data-default.

* lisp/url-http.el (url-parse-viewer-types): Apply both mm-mime-data and
  mm-mime-data-default when building the acceptable viewer list.

1998-12-28  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Use an unwind-protect form
  around w3-draw-tree.  This means that even if something in the drawing
  causes an error, the buffer will still be thrown into w3-mode
  (w3-region): Make w3-region interactive and give it a doc string.
  (w3-pause): Mark the buffer as temporarily read-only, so that
  self-inserting keystrokes will signal an error, which will be caught and 
  ignored by the condition-case.
  (w3-widget-buffer): New function to get the buffer a widget is in.
  (w3-widget-echo): Use it, since with Gnus, it is very likely that you
  will be in a different buffer when you are mousing around the rendered
  HTML.

* lisp/url-file.el (url-file): Modify the filename in the URL if we are
  actually visiting a directory without a trailing '/' or '\', and we do
  the auto-find of the index.html file.

* lisp/url.el (url-looks-like-html): New function that determines whether
  a document looks like HTML or not.  This is for ancient HTTP/0.9
  responses for things without a file extension (ie: /, /a/b/, etc)
  (url-retrieve-internally): Use it if we cannot find a content-type any
  other way.

* lisp/url-cid.el: Try to avoid compile-time-errors when gnus' mm-decode
  cannot be found.

1998-12-26  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url.el (url-expand-file-name): Make sure to normalize the 'default' 
  value before we get to the point of bailing out if we get the empty
  string, otherwise the vector-ized version of the URL could sneak out,
  and the 'nil' default case would screw us too.

1998-12-26  Markus Rost  <markus.rost@mathematik.uni-regensburg.de>

* w3-display.el (w3-display-get-cookie): No buffer-file-name for "
  *cookie*" buffers.

1998-12-26  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/base64.el: Added alias for base64-encode-string -> base64-encode
  and base64-decode-string -> base64-decode, for compatibility with
  Emacs/XEmacs with native base64 support.

* lisp/w3-about.el: Use base64-encode-string instead of base64-encode, for 
  compatibility with Emacs/XEmacs with native base64 support.

1998-12-25  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url-ldap.el: New file to implement LDAP support ala RFC2255

* lisp/url.el (url-do-setup): Register the LDAP URL handler if the feature 
  is present.

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre36 released

* lisp/url.el (url-default-expander): Make sure that we remove any query
  strings from the URL before we remove relative links.
  (url-remove-relative-links): Tack on a trailing '/' if necessary so that 
  we don't fail any URL parsing tests on things like 'g/.', which should
  be normalized to just 'g/'

1998-12-24  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url-cookie.el (url-cookie-host-can-set-p): Fixed cookie
  vulnerability as described in
  http://www.paradise.net.nz/~glineham/cookiemonster.html

1998-12-23  Markus Rost  <markus.rost@mathematik.uni-regensburg.de>

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-initialize-w3-mode-menu-map): Block also
  the global menubar entry [menubar mule].

1998-12-23  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-cus.el (w3-force-conversion-alist): Mixed mismatched custom type
  (w3-default-stylesheet): Ditto.
  (w3-html-errors-font-lock-keywords): Ditto.
  (w3-default-configuration-file): Ditto.
  (w3-modeline-format): Ditto.

1998-12-22  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre35 released

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-get-default-color): Function to get the default
  foreground or background color, even if face-(fore|back)ground returns
  nil, which it does under Emacs fairly often.  We fall back to getting
  the colors out of the frame properties.  I think this is gross, but oh
  well.
  (w3-display-background-useless-p): Use it.
  (w3-display-foreground-useless-p): Use it.

* lisp/w3.el (w3-reload-document): Avoid using interactive spec 'Z', since 
  it doesn't exist in older versions of Emacs (19.xx)

* lisp/w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Add ',' to the `whitespace' at the
  front of an attribute that we should skip over.  This is so that people
  can do horrible nasty things like <input type="foo", name="bar"> and
  still have it work.  Sometimes I feel so... unclean.

* lisp/url-news.el (url-check-gnus-version): Use gnus-continuum-version if 
  at all possible.  This way I will never have to add another string-match 
  to the list of acceptable versions (at least not until another 15
  releases of Gnus.

1998-12-22  Dave Love <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-image-alt): Pay better attention to the alt
  specified by the document.  Don't try to special case the empty string
  so much.

1998-12-22  William Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/css.el (css-parse): Wrap the calls to forward sexp in
  condition-case so that an invalid stylesheet does not completely choke.

1998-12-22  Milan Zamazal <pdm@pvt.net>

* lisp/w3.el (w3-replace-invalid-chars): Make sure we tell replace-regexp
  to be 'literal' so that somet hings in the invalid chars table don't
  signal an error (ie: S\\v was looking for the regexp quote match, etc)

1998-12-22  William Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-display-table): Backed out old change to use less 
  space for borderless tables - it was screwing up spacing at the
  beginning of celles.

  cus-dep installed.

* lisp/w3.el (w3-fetch): Avoid use of with-current-buffer, since it
  doesn't exist in Emacs 19.xx 
  (w3-convert-code-for-mule): Finished rename to mule-coding-system-p

1998-12-20  Bertil Askelid <bertil@ioc.net>

  is modified.

1998-12-18  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/Makefile.in: No longer include auto-autoloads.el and custom-load in 
  the distribution.  We can rebuild it anywhere now.

* aclocal.m4 (AC_CHECK_CUSTOMLOADS): Use the new functions in the
  appropriate place.
  (EMACS_REBUILD_AUTOLOADS): Ditto.

* lisp/docomp.el (emacs-build-custom-load): New function to build
  custom-load.el under Emacs.
  (emacs-build-autoloads): Ditto for the auto-autoloads.el file.

1998-12-15  Kenichi Handa  <handa@etl.go.jp>

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre32 released

* lisp/font.el (font-x-font-regexp): Add a trailing dash to the
  font-regexp.  For some reason Emacs 19.xx under 95/NT sticks a trailing
  slash on the end.  This was the cause of the odd errors in
  font-spatial-to-canonical since it was getting an empty font object
  because the regexp failed to match.

1998-12-16  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3.el (w3-coding-system-for-mime-charset): Make sure the
  coding-system-p is defined before we use it.
  (w3-convert-code-for-mule): Ditto.

* Makefile.in (SUPPORTFILES): Now include 'BUGS' support file in the
  distributions.

1998-12-16  Simon Josefsson <jas@pdc.kth.se>

  MAILCAPS variable.

1998-12-16  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

1998-12-08  Ken'ichi HANDA <handa@etl.go.jp>

* lisp/mule-sysdp.el (mule-detect-coding-version): Check that
  mule-sysdep-version is a number before comparing it to one.  Under
  XEmacs it is a symbol `xemacs'.

1998-12-03  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Updated all copyright dates and now specify that this _is_ a
  part of Emacs, since it soon will be.  Maybe.  If I get ambitious.  what 
  are the odds posted in vegas?

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-display-infer-contrasting-color): New function to 
  chooise black or white as an appropriate color if the author of an HTML
  page was stupid enough to do something like: <body bgcolor="white"> (ie: 
  not specifying the foreground color as well).  If this conflicts with
  the users foreground, the text used to be invisible.  Now it will be
  whichever contrasts best (black on mint cream, white on dark red, etc)
  (w3-display-node): If the foreground specified conflicts with the users' 
  background, ignore it.
  (w3-display-node): If the background specified conflicts with the users' 
  foreground, infer an appropriate foreground.

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre31 released

* configure.in (CIDFILE): Stop spitting out a warning about
  multipart/related stuff if we can't find Gnus at configure time.  We're
  hacking around it in a different way now.

* lisp/Makefile.in (URLSOURCES): Add url-cid.el into the definition via
  configure substitutions ONLY.  It will still get installed because we
  stick it in EXTRAS.  This means 1 extra file copy at install time, but
  who cares?  The file isn't that large.

* lisp/url-cid.el: New file to contain the content-id handling stuff,
  because we cannot compile this file unless we can find a very recent
  version of Gnus at compile time (without .emacs).

* etc/default.css: Use the newer @media tags instead of @x*emacs so that
  everything will work right with the new Emacs redisplay.

* lisp/css.el (css-active-device-types): Added new @media tags.
  multifont is now defined if the Emacsen we are running in can display
  multiple font families and sizes correctly (new emacs redisplay or
  XEmacs), and unifont if it cannot.

* lisp/font.el (font-set-face-font-new-redisplay): New function for
  dealing with the new Emacs redisplay font abstraction.  You can now beat 
  the crap out of the new redisplay engine with Emacs/W3.  Ahh, feels like 
  the heady old days of Lucid Emacs 19.10 and XEmacs 19.12.

1998-12-02  Simon Josefsson <jas@pdc.kth.se>

* lisp/mm.el (mm-parse-mailcaps): Deal gracefully with bad entries in the
  MAILCAP list, or it would bug out with things like 'file:' where it
  would try to open the current directory.

1998-11-29  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/docomp.el (load-path): Append the GNUSDIR environment variable to
  the load-path, similar to how we deal with WIDGETDIR

* INSTALL: Document the new --with-gnus arguments.

* configure.in: Use AC_CHECK_GNUS and spit out appropriate warnings about
  cid URLS not working when appropriate.

* aclocal.m4 (AC_CHECK_GNUS): Try to find mm-get-content-id in mm-decode
  for newer gnus releases that can handle the content-id stuff.  Also
  added new configure switch '--with-gnus=/path/to/gnus/lisp/dir' to
  override this, similar to how the custom stuff works.

* lisp/url-misc.el (url-cid-gnus): Try to load mm-decode at compile time.
  (url-cid-gnus): Fixed some compilation warnings.

* lisp/url.el (url-cid): Ooops - forgot to add an autoload for url-cid

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre30 released

* lisp/url.el (url-do-setup): Duh, forgot to register the CID handler.
  Good thing lars was doing it too.

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre29 released

* lisp/url-misc.el (url-cid): New URL handler for dealing with content-id
  based references.  Able to be extended for different mail/news readers.
  Need to coordinate with Lars and Kyle on exactly how to determine which
  UA is invoking us, so we don't try and use Gnus functions when VM is
  giving us the data, etc.
  (url-cid-gnus): First implementation of CID retrieval for Pterodactyl
  Gnus.

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-finalize-image-download): Make sure we call
  url-uncompress in w3-finalize-image-download, or content-id and data URL 
  based images won't get uncompressed correctly.  Arguably this should be
  done in url-default-callback, but I'm not sure what that would fubar
  right now.

* lisp/w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Changed regexp for handling
  NET-enabling start tags to be not so restrictive.  I don't think this
  will have any negative side-effects

1998-11-28  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre28 released

1998-11-23  Thierry Emery <Thierry.Emery@nmu.alcatel.fr>

  w3-sentinel) and moved use of w3-mime-charset-coding-alist to
  w3-coding-system-for-mime-charset;

* lisp/w3.el
  (w3-convert-code-for-mule): added call to w3-coding-system-for-mime-charset
  for handling specified MIME charset;
  (w3-coding-system-for-mime-charset): code moved from
  mule-detect-coding-version, which uses w3-mime-charset-coding-alist;
  (w3-sentinel): moved downcase of MIME type and charset to
  w3-convert-code-for-mule call arguments and generalized it to encoding;
  replaced hacking out "x-" in MIME charsets with proper reference to
  w3-mime-charset-coding-alist in w3-coding-system-for-mime-charset.

1998-11-20  Ken'ichi HANDA <handa@etl.go.jp>

  w3-mime-charset-coding-alist,
  w3-url-domain-language-environment-alist, and
  w3-url-domain-coding-alist.

  default-enable-multibyte-characters is nil, does no code
  conversion.

* lisp/url-cache.el (url-store-in-cache): Write to a file with no
  code conversion.

* lisp/w3.el (w3-convert-code-for-mule): Call

  to be `scroll-up', added bindings for C-b, C-n and C-p.

* lisp/w3-cus.el (w3-latex-use-latex2e): Documentation fix.  LaTeX
  "generator" makes more sense than "parser".

* lisp/url.el (url-do-setup): ditto for url-cookie-file and

  point-max changes due to a set-buffer-multibyte operation.

1998-10-28  Laurent Martelli <martelli@iie.cnam.fr>

* Patches to add hotindex support.  It's a patch to W3/Emacs allowing you
  to associate keywords to your  hotlist  entries.  You can then query
  for  the entries matching a keyword. I  did  this because  I find it
  hard  to find  a particular bookmark when  you more than  a hundred,
  even with hotlist-apropos. And I think  that folders and subfolders
  are not  very convenient because  an entry usually belongs to more
  than one folder.

1998-10-26  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs/W3 4.0pre25 released

  family stuff if w3-user-fonts-take-precedence != nil

1998-10-23  Lars Marius Garshol <larsga@ifi.uio.no>

* lisp/url-file.el (url-cleanup-file): New function for removing
  questionable practices from file urls before we fetch them.  Should fix
  lots of the problems where we tried to ftp when we shouldn't have.

1998-10-23  William Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-face-for-element): Use it.

* */Makefile.in: Fixed the automatic rebuilding based on
  configure/aclocal.m4 and config.status.  Everything should build in a
  separate source directory now.

* lisp/w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-image): Fix for image submit buttons.

1998-09-08  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-parse.el: Allow '?' in unquoted attribute values, so that CGI
  queries in unquoted HREFs work correctly.

1998-08-30  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/docomp.el: Added approprate magic to add the
  custom-declare-variable byte-hunk-handler so that in version of Emacs <=
  19.34, customized variables do not show up as 'free' to the byte
  compiler.

1998-08-22  T. V. Raman <raman@Adobe.COM>

* lisp/w3-speak-table.el: Implemented table navigation for nested tables

  file w3-cfg.nt.

* lisp/w3.el (w3-viewer-filter): Start showing output from the viewer
  program as soon as we get it instead of after it exits.  This allows
  viewers to spit out instructions on their use (ie: imageviewer under

  compile for those NT/Win95 people.

Wed Jun 17 18:30:11 1998  Jonathan Harris <jhar@tardis.ed.ac.uk>

* lisp/font.el (mswindows-font-create-object): various mswindows fixes -
  please speak up if anything is broken!

1998-06-18  Stefan Hornburg  <racke@gundel.han.de>

* lisp/url-file.el (url-file): Fixed a regexp that should match drive

1998-06-13  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-hot.el (finish-submenu): Ignore empty strings when searching for

  this shit any more. :)

* lisp/w3-menu.el (w3-menu-breakup): Moved into this file because it is
  where it belongs.  Also changed so that 'more...' menu items are spliced 
  in at the end of the menu where they belong.
  All the filter menus should work under Emacs 20.3 now.
  (w3-popup-menu): No longer use 'popup-menu' - this removes the need
  under Emacs to (require 'lmenu), which caused lots and lots of problems
  with invalid macros, etc.

1998-06-10  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/w3-menu.el (w3-menu-filters-supported-p): New variable to determine

  (w3-menu-html-links-constructor): Make this work with easymenu.

  mule-write-region-no-coding-system so that all the MULE variations are

* lisp/mule-sysdp.el (mule-retrieval-coding-system,

1998-06-04  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* lisp/url-http.el (url-create-mime-request): New behaviour wrt
  url-mime-language-string - if it is nil, then no accept-language header

  danish or japanese) - definitely suboptimal.  I don't know how this will 
  impact you MULE folks though - speak up!

  file-name-handler-alist to nil just to get around auto-compression

* lisp/w3-display.el (w3-widget-echo): Use
  buffer-substring-no-properties for w3-widget-echo to avoid spurious
  'attempt to change text outside editable field' errors.  Is this needed

* Only use one conditionalization variable - w3-running-xemacs

1997-06-26  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  compile with Emacs 19.

Tue Jun 24 11:44:59 1997  Per Abrahamsen  <abraham@dina.kvl.dk>

* Emacs/W3 3.0.90 released

* Moved the documentation into its own subdirectory

* w3-menu.el: Slightly less complete version of id-menubar-set when not in

  non-existent hook.  Bleah.

* configure.in: Fixed AC_CHECK_PROG for emacs/xemacs - duh.

  specifying mode menubars.

* w3-toolbar.el (w3-add-toolbar-to-buffer): Don't install the toolbar
  under InfoDock - it uses different toolbars than straight XEmacs.

* w3-mouse.el: Don't bind shift-button2 - this is reserved for hyperbole.
  This is now on meta.

  knowledge of internals of the widget library.

Tue Jun 17 21:45:06 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* custom-check: Was misusing 'tr'

Sat Jun 14 15:37:09 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  anal.

  (w3-maybe-start-background-image-download): Don't try to load background
  images in Emacs 19 or on a TTY.

* w3-parse.el : Allow <meta> tags in %body.content for stupid cnn.com
  site.

* Emacs/W3 3.0.87 released.

  gnus or something like that before the one in the w3 directory.

* w3-display.el (w3-maybe-start-background-image-download): New function
  that takes a URL and a face and does its best to set the background
  pixmap of that face to the image pointed to by the URL.
  (w3-display-node): Implemented 'background' property on 'body' or 'html' 
  tags.
  (w3-finalize-image-download): Changed a fair bit - shared between normal 
  image downloads and background image downloads.
  (w3-display-node): w3-user-colors-take-precedence now controls whether
  background faces are retrieved or not.

  completely now.

  (w3-mode): Dont' set inhibit-read-only, ever.
  (w3-mode): back to using widget-minor-mode, since inheriting the keymap
  doesn't seem to do much good.

* w3-vars.el: Don't bind anything to widget-button-press, let
  widget-minor-mode do that.

* w3.el (w3-map-links): Revamped this to work with the new way widget is
  using overlays instead of text properties.

  character set when loading this file more than once.
  (w3-display-node): Rearranged some of the insert-before handling so that 
  any text inserted does _not_ have the properties of the tag on it
  (colors on hyperlinks won't bleed anymore)
  (w3-resurrect-hyperlinks): New semi-working way of resurrecting
  hyperlinks

Mon Jun  9 22:53:14 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Call w3-do-setup to make sure our

Mon Jun  9 22:26:29 1997  Michael Ernst <mernst@cs.washington.edu>

* url.el (url-get-url-filename-chars): Fixed problem with bad use of a

  - will now use the more correct one that was already there.

  incremental display.

* w3.el (w3-view-this-url): Check the parent widget for an href if you
  don't find one right away.  This means that all commands that act on the
  URL at point will now work on image widgets, etc. that are hyperlinks.

Sat May 10 14:37:25 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  directives.

  facility for bad cookie 'set' commands, was too annoying.

* w3.el (w3-save-as): Make sure to require ps-print before trying to
  save/mail a document as postscript.  The local binding of
  ps-spool-buffer-name was causing the defvar not to happen, and you would 
  get errors when trying to kill emacs later.  Ugh.
  (w3-document-information): Make sure to escape entities for meta and
  other info we throw in.

* url-file.el (url-file): ftp/file retrieval can now be asynchronous
  through the magic of [ange-ftp|efs]-copy-file-internal

* Emacs/W3 3.0.85 released

* w3-display.el (w3-display-table-dimensions): Deal with

  custom-land where they belong.

* devices.el: Removed defsubsts so that we should be able to share .elc
  files again between emacs and XEmacs.

* font.el: Added in code to make a face blink.  Causes lots of screen
  flicker under Emacs 19 though, so it is turned off by default.  Turn it
  on with ESC-: (font-blink-initialize) - should be able to optimize when
  the callback actually does anything based on what fonts are visible in
  the visible buffers.
  (font-face-visible-in-window-p): New function to tell if a face is
  visible in a buffer window.
  (font-map-windows): New function to map a function over all visible

  backgrounds don't puke and die.

* w3.el (w3-find-default-stylesheets): Don't load a user's personal
  stylesheet if we started up in '-q' mode.

* Emacs/W3 3.0.84 released

* w3-display.el: When using XEmacs 20.x w/mule support, we now define our
  own special character set.  This means that the table border chars work
  again in XEmacs/mule

* devices.el: Added magic to not optimize this file under XEmacs - its not 
  actually used, so no damage.  It wouldn't compile under XEmacs because
  it has subrs for all these, and our declaring them as defsubsts
  thoroughly confuses the byte-compiler.

Sun Apr 20 12:19:56 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-sysdp.el: Moved device stuf out into its own devices.el file so that
  it can be correctly byte-compiled.

  (#foo) is not found.

Tue Apr 15 08:22:37 1997  John Palmieri <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

* w3.el (w3-complete-link): protect against errors when hitting return
  when point isn't on a link

* w3.el (w3-complete-link): now correctly defaults to following the link

  tags.

  'ignore so that stupid 'process xxx exited with code nnn' messages are
  not shown.

* w3.el (w3-viewer-sentinel): ditto

* Emacs/W3 3.0.79 released

  whether image widgets are rendered inaudible by emacspeak or not.
  (widget-image-value-set): Use it.

* url-cache.el (url-cache-directory): New variable that controls where you
  cache files will be stored.  Defaults to "~/.w3/cache"
  (url-cache-creation-function): New variable that controls what function
  will be used to create cached filenames.
  (url-cache-create-filename-using-md5): This is now the default (and
  only) cache-file-creation function.  Suitably fast under Emacs 19 (lisp
  implementation), _very_ fast under XEmacs, where it is written in C.

Thu Feb 27 07:27:43 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-sysdp.el: Added alias of make-symbolic-link to copy-file for NTEmacs

Wed Feb 26 08:17:37 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-region): Fixed typo when binding
  w3-display-same-buffer - no wonder it wasn't working right.

* images.el (image-normalize): Bind file-coding-system to the appropriate
  no-conversion so that running subprocesses doesn't munge the data when
  running under MULE.
  (image-normalize): Now uses call-process-region instead of
  shell-command-on-region, and removed the explicit mention of '/bin/bash'
  and friends.  Uses the ability of call-process-region to specify a
  separate file to use for stderr - yipeee.

* url.el (url-setup-privacy-info): Slight change as to how url-system-type
  and url-os-type are set up.  No longer uses nested parens, as this seems
  to confuse some sites that try to use the User-Agent header as a
  state-tracker.

Mon Feb 24 10:15:45 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-widget-echo): Make sure that nothing that will be
  echoed is the empty string.

Sun Feb 23 08:34:18 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* url-cache.el (url-store-in-cache): fixed stupid bug in caching logic

Sat Feb 22 07:21:29 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

Thu Feb 20 07:33:59 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  we have a match before passing a URL off to w3-fetch.

* Synch'd up to widget 1.44

* url.el (url-default-callback): Caching works in asynch mode now.

Wed Feb 19 05:48:40 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* css.el (css-split-font-shorthand): Make sure that the subelements of the
  'font' shorthand property get run through the property value-expansion
  routines before getting returned.  This royally screwed up font-family,
  font-weight, and friends.
  (css-expand-color):  Now recognizes 'transparent' and 'none' as special
  color names.
  (css-expand-value): When dealing with color-shorthand, make sure
  everything gets run through the value-expansion routines as well.  Ack.

* w3-elisp.el (w3-elisp-safe-function): You can now supply a validation
  function for the arguments of a script-enabled function, its no longer a
  binary operation on just the function name.  You can also give it a
  variable name, and the value of that variable at the time of execution
  is what controls whether it is safe or not.

* w3.el (w3-download-url): Finally fixed bug where w3-download-url would
  not save in the correct directory if you just accepted the default
  pathname it offered.

* url-cache.el (url-cache-ignored-protocols): New variable controlling
  what protocols we should never cache to disk.
  (url-cache-cachable-p): use it.

* w3.txi: Updated all nodes and menus, a few stylistic changes

* w3-elisp.el: Added read-access to devices, frames, windows, buffers, and
  property-lists.  Also added function, lambda, point, and list accessors
  (member, memq, assoc)

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): Bind widget-push-button-gui to nil in
  w3-display-node so that images don't run into the
  visible-portion-of-buffer-is-not-modifiable-bug.  Ick.

* w3-elisp.el: Don't allow access to 'set'-type text-property functions
  from scripts.

Tue Feb 18 15:11:08 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs-W3 3.0.61 released

* w3.txi (Supported URLs): added sections on each protocol supported -
  needs lots of fleshing out.

  you can have something like info:w3.info#Getting%20Started

* url.el (url-do-setup): Removed secure-http (SHTTP) handler - who the
  hell cares anymore, it lost.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): Correctly calculates right margin as
  documented (from window-width and right-margin)

* w3.el: Removed w3-batch-fetch

* url-vars.el: Removed lots of old variables

* url-misc.el: Removed x-exec URL handler - no interest anymore.

* w3-script.el (w3-script-evaluate-form): Use it.
(w3-do-scripting): New variable to control whether to do _any_ scripting
or not.

* The URL package now stores the current parsed URL object instead of 5 or
  6 separate variables.

* dist.Makefile: Removed old pgp and wais support, it was gross and
  apparently nobody was using it.

Tue Feb 18 06:13:03 1997  "T. V. Raman" <raman@adobe.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-summarize-radio-button): Better radio button
  summarizer.

Tue Feb 18 06:13:03 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-finish-drawing): Moved #blah target finding in here,
  where it belongs.

* w3-vars.el (w3-mode-map): Added binding for raw '\t' instead of relying
  on [tab].  Apparently this keysym isn't aliased under Emacs 19 on a
  TTY.

Mon Feb 17 15:10:38 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-elisp.el: Interface to Emacs-Lisp for safe scripting.

* w3-e19.el (w3-mouse-handler): Plugged in handling of the onMouseOver event

* w3-display.el (w3-handle-string-content): Now adds a text property that
  contains w3-display-open-element-stack, so that from anywhere in the
  buffer you can find out where you are in the parse tree.

* default.css (input): ome default stylesheet updates for input fields on
  TTYs

Sun Feb 16 09:01:18 1997  Shuji Narazaki <narazaki@InetQ.or.jp>

  changes.

Thu Feb 13 07:01:59 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Synch'd up to widget 1.38

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-resurrect-widgets): For now, don't use the nice new
  GUI pushbuttons - they appear to suffer badly on long lines.

* w3-mouse.el (w3-running-FSF19): Use new w3-popup-menu-on-mouse-3 variable

* w3-vars.el: Removed _lots_ of obsolete variables
(w3-popup-menu-on-mouse-3): New variable to control whether W3 should
  override mouse-3 or not.

* Emacs-W3 3.0.58 released

* w3.txi: Added stubs for stylesheet chapters and supported URLs

* images.el (image-register-netpbm-utilities): This is now safe to call
  multiple times again.

Wed Feb 12 06:26:55 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-keymap): When binding widget-end-of-line, make sure
  that we do not overwrite Emacspeak's prefix-key.  Now does a
  where-is-internal to find the correct binding in global-map to
  override.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): bind :emacspeak-help to 'w3-widget-echo
  in all the hypertext links.

* w3-vars.el (w3-mode-map): New binding for \M-\t - this _should_ have
  been taken care of by the [(meta tab)] definition, but evidently it
  doesn't.  *sigh*

Tue Feb 11 07:33:50 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-option-list): Specify :menu-tag-get so that
  keyboard-based-completion doesn't get confused by the fact that some
  items will have spaces slapped in at the end.

* ssl.el (ssl-program-arguments): New variable - a list of command line
  switches to send to the SSL program in a subprocess, before the hostname
  and port number.
  (open-ssl-stream): Use it.

Mon Feb 10 07:45:31 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* url-file.el (url-dired-find-file-mouse): fixed bad typo of 
  (interactive...) spec, added documentation to a few functions.
  (url-file): Removed refs to obsolete variable url-use-hypertext-dired

* w3-xemac.el (w3-setup-version-specifics): Workaround for users of XEmacs
  19.14 or 20.0 with the bad bad bad lossage with text properties that
  have null values.  This  bug is fixed in XEmacs 19.15, and will be in
  20.1 as well.  This bug would cause you to get errors like:
	internal error: no text-prop <#extent ....> start-open

* w3.el (w3-widget-button-click): Deal with new image capabilities of the
  widget checkbox/radio-button stuff.

* Synch'ed up to widget 1.31

Sun Feb  9 15:39:19 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs-W3 3.0.57 released

* url-file.el (url-dired-minor-mode): New minor mode that overrides a few
  of direds keybindings to use Emacs-W3 instead of straight find-file.
  (url-format-directory): Now just uses dired to display directory
  listings, much more powerful than the old way.  Can copy files, act on
  multiple files, you all know the drill.

* w3.txi: Added more chapters, reorg of others.

* w3-display.el (w3-maybe-start-image-download): Fixed handling of bad
  images in the cache again.  Duh.
  No longer log to the warnings buffer if we fail to load an image.  Just
  use message - much less intrusive.  We just usually don't care that much
  about failed image loads.

* url-gw.el (url-open-stream): fixed typo - was calling old
  url-nslookup-host instead of url-gateway-nslookup-host

* w3.el (w3-insert-formatted-url): Now inserts markup in lowercase.

Sat Feb  8 13:54:43 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-summarize-radio-button): Finally, a decent
  summarization of radio buttons
  Fixed typo in specifying summarizer for hidden form fields.
  (w3-form-keymap): Bind C-a and C-e by default.

* w3-widget.el (widget-image-value-create): When using emacspeak, show
  client side imagemaps as a table.  Need a more general solution for
  this, but this makes us nicer than IE again. :)

* Updated to widget 1.30

Fri Feb  7 16:49:55 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-handle-string-content): Make sure faces text
  properties are closed, so that things don't bleed over.
  (w3-fixup-eol-faces): New function for Emacs 19 that removes face
  information at newlines, so that underlining will not extend from the
  end of a line to the window edges - very ugly.

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-initialize-w3-mode-menu-map): Don't support 'emacs
  in w3-use-menus under Emacs in Windows 95/NT.

* w3-display.el (w3-finalize-image-download): Deal with bad images better.
  (w3-finish-drawing): Better protection of putting images in.

  an error if you fail to connect to a site.  This is for image loadings
  that fail for some reason or another.

* css.el (css-expand-length): better handling of float values and 'ex'
  unit type.

* font.el (x-font-create-object): Unconditionally make case-fold-search
  non-nil so that we don't lose big-time.  This was the cause of the very
  weird font-spatial-to-canonical lossage under XEmacs with font sizes of
  something like '+12pt'

* w3.el (w3-view-this-url): Use widget-echo-help if we didn't find a URL
  under point.

Fri Feb  7 15:22:25 1997  Charles Levert <charles@comm.polymtl.ca>

* w3-widget.el (widget-image-notify): Bad data being fed to w3-fetch if a
  client-side imagemap had an alt attribute (but only if the <map> came
  _after_ the use.

Fri Feb  7 15:22:25 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* font.el (font-spatial-to-canonical): protect against bad input to this
  function.

Fri Feb  7 15:19:36 1997  Toby Speight <tms@ansa.co.uk>

* w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Parser didn't allow for the fact that
  TAGC is optional on end-tags as well as on start-tags (i.e. "<b<i>
  bold-italic</i</b>" is legal).

Fri Feb  7 06:28:37 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-keymap): Now inherits from widget-keymap, with a
  few exceptions.

* url.el (url-uncompress): This function now no longer looks at the file
  extension to determine a compression/encoding method.  This is so that
  doing searches on `foo.tar.gz' will not bogusly cause the decompression
  steps to run.  Ick!

* url-file.el (url-insert-possibly-compressed-file): This function no
  longer atempts to decompress the file after loading it in.  Instead, it
  sets an appropriate content-transfer-encoding header based on the
  filename, so that this will allow url-uncompress to work correctly on the
  buffer.

Thu Feb  6 06:24:26 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  use the old-style interaction with form fields instead of the 'type
  directly into the buffer' method
  (w3-form-determine-size): Use it.
  (w3-form-create-integer): Use it.
  (w3-form-create-float): Use it.
  (w3-form-create-text): Use it.

  (w3-revert-form): Fixed error with 'reset' buttons on forms that had
  hidden form fields.

* w3-display.el (w3-size-of-tree): Removed some warnings
(w3-display-table-dimensions): ditto

* Updated to widget 1.26

* default.css: Some default formatting changes for input fields.
  Everything is underlined by default except submit/reset/image/button
  fields, so that they are a little easier to spot.

* w3-parse.el (w3-parse-buffer): Now slaps pseudo-elements into input
  fields so that stylesheets can access them.

Wed Feb  5 14:42:12 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  keybindings for lynx emulation minor mode.

* Emacs-W3 3.0.55 released

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-determine-size): Fixed _STUPID_ problem where
  option lists would lose everything but the first option in them.  I'm a
  dumbass.  Sort modifies its list parameter! ICK ICK ICK.

* url.el (url-after-change-function): Show prettier status messages.
  Sizes are converted to bytes, k, or M, depending on how big the file
  is.

* w3.txi: Lots of documentation changes - volunteers welcome.

* Removed personal annotation support, since it wasn't shown with the new
  display engine, it needs to be rethought, and nobody had complained in
  the entire beta cycle.

* w3.el (w3-history-find-url-internal): Redid the history mechanism.
  Toolbar and menu entries are now grayed out appropriately.

* url-http.el (url-create-mime-request): Fixed cookie support if not going

  line-height in Emacs 19.

* w3-display.el (w3-face-for-element): Uhh, oblique seems to work.

Tue Jan 28 06:22:08 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* font.el (x-font-create-name): Never take font size into account under
  Emacs - too much chance of totally screwing up the users leading by
  choosing a bigger font than their default.  This sucks.  But I can't
  find a better solution.

* w3.el: w3-mode now turns on truncate-lines by default.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-image): Better image input type support.

Mon Jan 27 08:21:58 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-password): Now uses real password entry
  widgets provided by 'widget' - you _MUST_USE_ the widget library that
  comes with Emacs-W3 for this, otherwise the info won't be hidden
  correctly.
  (w3-form-add-element): Deal with hidden text areas better when they are
  in forms

* Synch'd up to widget 1.22

Sun Jan 26 16:50:09 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* Emacs-W3 3.0.51 released

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-create-text): Now uses the real text entry widgets

  though.

Sat Jan 25 13:38:12 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* url.el (url-expand-file-name): Now strips out spaces as well as
  newlines/carriage returns. More fixes for that bastardized microsoft
  home page.

* url-http.el (url-create-mime-request): Make sure that we retrieve the
  cookies for the real URL we are retrieving when going through a proxy.
  Now the psychotic crap that is the microsoft home page should be
  successfully retrieved if going through an HTTP proxy.

* url-cookie.el (url-cookie-handle-set-cookie): Attempt to deal with
  idiotic microsoft home page that sends out set-cookie headers that look
  like MC1=ID=abc, and expects two cookies MC1='' and ID='abc'  *sigh*

* w3-forms.el, w3-display.el: Form elements now keep all their attributes
  with them.  Will be useful when we start allowing scripting.
  (w3-form-create-custom): Rudimentary patches to allow embedding 'custom'
  widgets into the buffer.  Interesting.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-determine-size): New function to calculate how big
  a form field will be - option lists should look much better now.

* url-parse.el: document extra slots of url-generic-parse-url

  in a file/ftp URL so that you won't be prompted for the password, even
  if one was specified in the URL 

* url-parse.el (url-generic-parse-url): Fixed bug where specifying a
  username and password in the URL would downcase the username and
  password as well as the hostname.

Wed Jan 22 08:28:13 1997  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-display.el (w3-display-node): Keep track of the last form's action,
  for theoretically 'naked' input fields that we want to try and handle as
  best we can anyway.

* w3-parse.el: Much more lenient about where form elements can be found.

* w3-forms.el: summarizer functions now take the widget as an extra
  parameter.

* w3.el (w3-find-etc-directory): New function - not used yet.

* w3.txi: Warning!  You now need a very new version of texinfo to compile
  the .info or .dvi file yourself.

* url-mail.el (url-mail): Now tries to use message-mail if it is bound
  instead of just plain old 'mail'.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-add-element): Duh, fix hidden form fields.

  telnet, and rlogin URL loaders into one smarter function

  case-insensitive at this point?

  updates to text entry fields.
  (w3-revert-form): Everything should be reverted correctly, both in

  (css-parse): Better handling of '@' directives in general

  'in-place', so that things like MIME mailers/gnus readers can show HTML
  inline a lot easier.

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-resurrect-widgets): Fixed case where a widget goes
  all the way to point-max and next-single-property-change will return
  nil.  Would pass bad args to delete-region.

  the :filter entries under XEmacs do.  This will make things much easier
  in the future in not duplicating crufty menu-construction code once for
  XEmacs menu-structs and once for Emacs keymaps.

* w3-menu.el (w3-menu-html-links-constructor): Now works with the Emacs 19

Sun Dec 29 00:07:39 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* w3-forms.el (w3-form-add-element): Only insert stubs of the right length
  for a for element, and do munging of that text into the actual widgets
  later.  This saves us a lot of grief and heartache when handling things
  like radio buttons that span table elements because the markers have
  become completely insane by the time the next widget is ready to be
  created.

Sat Dec 28 17:24:08 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  table-dimensions tells us we have a 0 column or 0 row table.

  for widget-image-callback - hyperlinked images under Emacs 19 should
  work again.

* Emacs-W3 3.0.41 released

* url-parse.el (url-generic-parse-url): bind inhibit-read-only to 't' in
  url parsing buffers, to avoid 'attempt to modify read-only text'

  read-only text property set.

  Emacs19 again.

* css.el (css-expand-value): For margin and padding, make sure we _always_

  cause the display engine to crap out.
  (css-get): Fixed generic class-only lookups (.foo, etc)

* w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-list-type): Tweaks to list indentation

  side imagemaps.  Should really work this time.

* w3.el (w3-map-links): w3-map-links and hence w3-complete-link will now
  find images that are also hyperlinks.

Mon Dec 23 22:28:58 1996  William M. Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

  parsing url-view-url.

  'Host' header field when going through a proxy.
  (url-setup-reload-timer): Emacs 19 doesn't deal well with 0-length
  timeouts, so protect against trying to create one when dealing with the
  refresh header.

* w3-parse.el: Removed lots of crap for the old display engine - shouldn't
  cons up as much garbage as before.  Now it will just cons up garbage
  that we actually need.

Tue Dec 17 07:10:47 1996  William Perry  <wmperry@aventail.com>

* css.el (css-properties): New property type 'string-list' for font-family

* w3-style.el (w3-display-stylesheet): Fixed problem where

* css.el (css-get): Removed bogus recursive call to css-get, and moved the
  guts of css-get out into its own fuction, which is in turn inlined into
  css-get.  Might even make things faster.  At the least, I expect it to
  get rid of the 'takes two makes to make w3-display.elc' problem some
  people have been seeing.

* w3-display.el (w3-display-handle-list-type): Fixed stupid problem with
  margin handling where list-item display items were always flush-left

Fri Dec 13 02:51:24 1996  Greg Stark  <gsstark@mit.edu>

* w3.el (w3-sentinel): hack around bug that bit w3-preview-this-buffer 
                       but I don't know what the right thing for Mule.

  Modified some of the css properties to not be inherited - let
