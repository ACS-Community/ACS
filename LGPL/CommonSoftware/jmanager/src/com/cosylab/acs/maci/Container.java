/**
 * Container is an agent of MACI that is installed on every computer of the control system.

 * <OL> 
 *		<LI>Constructs components when the Manager instructs it to (see activate_component and deactivate_component).</LI> 
 *		<LI>Provides the components that it hosts with basic MACI services, such as: 
 *			<UL> 
 *				<LI>access to the Manager</LI> 
 * 				<LI>access to the Local Database</LI> 
 * 				<LI>access to other components (indirectly through the Manager)</LI> 
 * 				<LI>access to the ORB and POA</LI> 
 * 			</UL> 
 * 		<LI>Handles intricacies of working with the ORB and the POA, such as connecting the newly created components to the POA.</LI> 
 * 		<LI>Is responsive to a shutdown directive from the Manager, which can shutdown only the Container's process, or reboot the computer (see shutdown).</LI>

	 * Activate a Component whose type (class) and name (instance) are given. 
	 *
	 * In the process of activation, Component's code-base is loaded into memory if it is not there already. 
	 * The code-base resides in an executable file (usually a dynamic-link library or a shared library -- DLL). 
	 *
	 * On platforms that do not automatically load dependent executables (e.g., VxWorks),
	 * the Container identifies the dependancies by querying the executable and loads them automatically. 
	 *
	 * Once the code is loaded, it is asked to construct a servant of a given type. 
	 *
	 * The servant is then initialized with the Configuration Database (CDB) and
	 * Persistance Database (PDB) data. The servant is attached to the Component, and a
	 * reference to it is returned. 
	 *
	 * @param	handle	Handle of the Component that is being activated.
	 * 					This handle is used by the Component when it will present itself to the Manager.
	 * 					The Component is expected to remember this handle for its entire life-time.
	 * @param	executionId Execution ID.
	 * @param	name	Name of the Component to instantiate.
	 * @param	exe		Path to the executable file (a DLL or a shared library) in which the Component's code resides.
	 * 					The path is relative to the root directory in which all executable code is stored.
	 * 					The path must not contain dots, and uses slashes (not backslashes) to separate components of the path.
	 * 					The path must not include the extension, or any prefixes, so that it is platform independent.
	 * @param	type	The type of the Component to instantiate. The interpretation of this field depends on the executable.
	 * 					Type should uniquely identify the code-base which the Component will be executing.
	 * 					<B>Note:</B> Type name is a CORBA repository ID.
	 * @return			Returns the reference to the object that has just been activated.
	 *					If the Component could not the activated, a nil reference is returned.
