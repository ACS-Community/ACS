<h1>Event GUI Overview</h1>
The eventGUI is intended as a replacement for the Python-based acseventbrowser,
which has shown stability problems in the past. The new, Eclipse RCP (Java)-based
eventGUI does not include all the functionality that was offered by its
predecessor, but should be easier to use and understand.

There are three principal views:
<h2>Service Summary View</h2>
This hierarchical view displays high-level information concerning each of the instances of
the CORBA Notify Service that are currently running under ACS. At the time
of writing, these are:
<ol>
<li><b>Default Notify Service</b>: the first (default) instance to be used by subsystems for event communication; 
any non-preconfigured additional instances are shown as well if they are running</li>
<li><b>Logging Notify Service</b>: currently carries logs across the network</li>
<li><b>Archiving Notify Service</b>: carries those BACI properties for which it is enabled in the (TM)CDB</li>
<li><b>Archiving Notify Service</b>: carries alarms across the network</li>
</ol>
The leaves of the explorer-like tree show the number of consumers and the number of
suppliers for each of these Services. When monitoring is enabled (right-click
anywhere on the View and select "Start monitoring"), the recent (within the last
10 seconds) increase or decrease in the number of suppliers/consumers will be
shown next to the totals.
<h2>Channel Tree View</h2>
<h2>Event List View</h2>
Unless filtering (see below) is active, this View displays a scrolling list
of events, updated roughly once per second. A handful of high-level fields are shown
for each event, namely:
<ol>
<li><b>Timestamp</b>: </li>
<li><b>Event source</b>: </li>
<li><b>Number of events received for this channel</b>: </li>
<li><b>Event type</b>: </li>
<li><b>Number of events of this type received</b>: </li>
</ol>
Available memory is checked periodically, and when a low-water mark is reached, the
oldest events will be deleted from the list. Note the contrast between this behavior and
that of <tt>jlog</tt>, which can buffer log records to disk.
<h3>Filtering</h3>
This facility, most assuredly in a preliminary, experimental state, can select which <i>incoming</i> events
to display based on their type. Entering any part of a regular expression into the box
above the list will show only those events whose type is matched by the expression, and only
those which arrive <i>after</i> the filter is set. To resume full event display, the filter
text box should be cleared; again this is effective only for events arriving after the
filter box has been cleared.
Clicking on an event in this view will open the Event Detail View.
<h3>Event Detail View</h3>
This view (still somewhat of a work in progress) displays the decoded contents
of the selected event. In the case of an event that contains one or more
arrays, only the first 5 elements of the array will be shown.

Note that for large events, <I>e.g.</I>. with thousand-element arrays, display
of the event may take some time, as indicated by a rotating cursor.
