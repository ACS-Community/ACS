/**
 * ArchiveConsumer is designed solely for the purpose
 * of processing notification channel structured events sent automatically by
 * BACI properties under certain conditions. 
 * Calls are delegated to the encapsulated TweakedNCSubscriber instance that inherits from NCSubscriber.
 * This way we don't have to expose NCSubscriber methods that make no sense for this special subscriber.
 * <p>
 * These events are not IDL-defined structs! 
 * The type parameter IDLEntity is therefore cheating, to get by the checks in the base class.
 * This is OK because we intercept the events at the 'push_structured_event_called' level, 
 * before any event type information gets applied in the processing.
 * See ACS/Documents/Logging_and_Archiving.doc (currently a bit outdated) 
 * and archiveevents :: archiveeventsArchiveSupplier.cpp for detail of the sender code. 
 * Filtering using the extended trader constraint language should work.
 * <p>
 * Basically all one has to do to use
 * this class is create an ArchiveConsumer object providing an ArchiveReceiver callback,
 * and then invoke the startReceivingEvents() method. 
 * <p>
 * Note that in Alma the archiving NC has been replaced by the TMCDB monitoring framework.
 * The eventGUI is the only known Java client for the old archiving NC, thus we continue 
 * supporting this class at medium inspiration level.
