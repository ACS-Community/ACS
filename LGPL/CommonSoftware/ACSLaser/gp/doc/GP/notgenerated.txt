The whole website is in CVS except the directories:
 - cgi-bin 
 - those starting with an "_" which are generated by the web server except 
the "_notgenerated" one which contains all the stuff too big to be added in CVS :

 _notgenerated\presentations   => PPT presentations
 _notgenerated\meetings        => meetings minutes
 _notgenerated\tools           => all the tools realated stuff that can be downloaded
