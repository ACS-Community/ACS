Changes for GP 2.0.8
- Given issue CSR-22, and as no one uses the functionality to change the font, I have removed it.
- setRowHeight() remains.
- BeanActionSupport.performCapability now throws InvocationTargetException, which is caught in 
  BeanSupport.performAction(). This allows projects to override BeanActionSupport.performCapability() 
  and catch, in one single place, the exceptions thrown in their Action classes.
  Example: cesar-guiutil/cern.spsea.gui.util.ActionAccessControlSupport

Issue CSR-22: GP version (2.0.7) has problems with the first column text, sometims there are only some dots "..."
See http://issues.cern.ch/browse/CSR-22

  resides in the desktop.

  - Moved to new package: cern.gp.printing

    way of printing their components.
