for debugging:
manualTest - runs the main test class through jUnit's command line
test runner

tat testing:
1) commandcenterTest - runs the main test class through Acs' test runner


the output of the script-commands started by command center goes to 
./scriptlogs/runXX/yy_<name_of_test_procedure>. 
where XX is incremented with every test run (starting with 01)
and yy reflects the order of execution of test procedures, e.g.

scriptlogs/run01/01_test_Start_Local_ServicesAndManager
scriptlogs/run01/02_test_Stop_Local_ServicesAndManager
...

2) acscommandcenterGUITest - tests the acscommandcenter GUI via qftestJUI that of course needs to be installed in the same machine 

The output of the script-command goes to ./tatlogs/run<X>/acscommandcenterGUITest.out reporting the exit status

Another detail output goes to ./acscommandcenter.html
