The ws/test directory contains 2 type of testes:
- only WS (test clients and test server(s) run on WS
- both WS/LCU (test clients run on WS and server(s) on LCU)

If there is defined environment variable WIND_BASE both WS/LCU testes
will take place otherwise only WS testes.

Reference files:
The reference files are in ref_BOTH and ref_WS, respectively and them
subdirectory ref (e.g. ref_BOTH/ref and ref_WS/ref).
The Make file copies apropriate  reference files into test/ and test/ref
depending on finding or not WIND_BASE environment variable. 

NOTE: If you generate new reference files you have to copy them into
appropriate directory (ref_BOTH or ref_WS and ref subdirectory).


TestList files:
There are two TestList.lite files:
 - TestList_WS.lite (Specifies two VLT environments: wsTat and lcuTat)
 - TestList_BOTH.lite (Specifies only one VLT enviroment: wsTat)
Depending on definition of enviroment varibale the make file copies
one of them to TestList.lite


TestDriver file:
The TestDriver file defines the RTAPENV environment variable in
"WS only" (WIND_BASE is not defined) case it takes value of "wsTat" in
"BOTH" case (WIND_BASE is defined) it takes value of
"lcuTat" from the .testSession file.


The Makefile:
It is cahnged so that it copies appropirate reference files and TestList.lite file.
