How to make new enum property (in ACS 1.0)

1) First you have to define new (enum) property in IDL:
 - include in your idl file enumpropMACRO.idl
- and then use macro ENUM(new_property_name); which will define all IDL
interfaces for new property (RO and RW)

Example of doing this is in file: enumpropTestDevice.idl.

2) Implementation of new property is already done using C++ templates and it is
in file enumpropROImpl.h and enumpropROImpl.i

If you want to use new property you will have to do smth. like:

m_currentState = new ROEnumImpl<ACS_ENUM_T(new_property_name), 
POA_new_property_module::ROnew_property_name>("name_of_property",  m_cob);

where:
new_property_name is name using in IDL
new_property_module is the name of module where new property is defined
name_of_property is the name of property (using for accessing data from
config. DB)

For details see example:
include/enumpropTestDeviceImpl.h
  and
test/enumpropTestDeviceImpl.cpp


3) CDB:
There is defined new class for enum properties: enumProperty.class
You have to include this file in your class file for device.

Example how to do this is in file: enumpropTestDevice.class
