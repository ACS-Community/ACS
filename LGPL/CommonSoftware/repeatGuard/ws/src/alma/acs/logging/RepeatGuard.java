/**
 * This class can be used to reduce the repeated execution of any kind of code, 
 * by keeping track of the number of intended executions and the time passed since the last actual execution,
 * and comparing these against configured values (see details below).
 * <p>
 * A reduction of the number of executions can be useful if that code is resource intensive (e.g. DB access, remote calls, logging)
 * or has other unwanted side effects if executed too often (e.g. annoying the user with too frequent error or confirmation dialogues). 
 * Of course this only makes sense if the nature of the problem allows skipping some of these executions.
 * <p>
 * This class is so general that it does not actually execute any code; it simply keeps track of counters and timer.
 * It can be used directly to manage decisions about skipping or executing some code.
 * For example, the application can instantiate a <code>RepeatGuard</code> with the timer set to one second. 
 * Then whenever the repetitive action would be called, the application first calls {@link #check()};
 * for every timer interval, only the first call to <code>check()</code> will return <code>true</code>, 
 * while the subsequent calls will return <code>false</code>, and the application should skip the repeated block of code.
 * Alternatively this class can be extended or wrapped to become easier to use for specific purposes.
 * Then typically the code to be executed (e.g. logging a message) becomes part of the specialized repeat guard class, 
 * as in {@link RepeatGuardLogger}.
 * <p>
 * The concept of repeat guards in ACS is discussed at http://almasw.hq.eso.org/almasw/bin/view/ACS/LoggingRepetitionControl
 * <p> 
 * Repetitions can be reduced using
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the number of times that code execution should be skipped before the code can be executed again
 *   <li>a timer which allows only one execution per time interval,
 *       no matter how many execution attempts have been made in the meantime,
 *   <li><code>OR</code> combination of the above: either enough attempts were made or enough time has passed, whatever happens first
 *   <li><code>AND</code> combination: enough skipped execution attempts, and enough time passed. 
 * </ol>
 * see also the {@link Logic} enum.
