Running test:

start server(s):
acserrTestServer <name_of_server> [dest_server]

ex.
acserrTestServer s1 &
acserrTestServer s2 s1


start client:

acsTestClient <error_server_name> <depth> <isError> [number_of_iteration]
[-ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc::$HOST:10000/NameService]

ex.

1) logging into file: /tmp/local_log.dat (you can set to other file
by setting env. var. ACS_LOG_FILE)
testClient s2 3 1

2) logging into the Centralized Logger 
(Naming Service and Logging Service must be run (startORBSVCS) and
LogClient (startLogClient) )
testClient s2 3 1 2 -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc::te1:10000/NameService


If you want brief output of logging also on the screen you will have
to set env. var. ACS_LOG_STDOUT=0 !
