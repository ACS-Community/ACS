We need this dummy CDB directory since ACS 8.2, because now acsStart will fail if the CDB directory does not exist. (This module test itself does not need a CDB at all).
We cannot rely on the default CDB, as the script acsutilTATPrologue will automatically change ACS_CDB from $ACSDATA/config/defaultCDB to $PWD.
