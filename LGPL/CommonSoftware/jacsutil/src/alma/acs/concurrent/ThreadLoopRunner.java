/**
 * This class allows running some task repeatedly with a given delay.
 * It is similar to the loop in C++ class ACS::Thread.
 * <p>
 * The code of the task to be executed gets passed to the constructor as a {@link Runnable} object.
 * The time between executions is given in the constructor and can later be changed through 
 * {@link #setDelayTime(long, TimeUnit)}.
 * <p> 
 * If the task takes some time to execute, you should consider implementing a soft cancel option. To do this,
 * extend {@link #CancelableRunnable} instead of simply implementing <code>Runnable</code>.
 * When the action should be canceled (e.g. due to {@link #shutdown(long, TimeUnit)}), the <code>shouldTerminate</code>
 * flag will be set. Your code should check this flag at convenient times, and should return if the flag is set.
 * Alternatively you can override the cancel method and terminate the task thread in different ways.
 * <p>
 * Method {@link #runLoop()} starts the loop.
 * Optionally the loop can be stopped with {@link #suspendLoop()} or {@link #suspendLoopAndWait(long, TimeUnit)}, 
 * and can also be restarted with another call to {@link #runLoop()}.
 * To stop the loop for good, call {@link #shutdown(long, TimeUnit)}.
 * <p>
 * While the underlying classes from the JDK <code>concurrent</code> package could also be used directly,
 * this class allows for shorter code that is also more similar to the style used in C++.
 * Especially it imposes the limit of running one task repeatedly, which gives an easier API,
 * at the expense of creating a separate instance of ThreadLoopRunner for some other repeated task.
 * (The older JDK class {@link java.util.Timer} has problems recovering from errors and should not be used.)
