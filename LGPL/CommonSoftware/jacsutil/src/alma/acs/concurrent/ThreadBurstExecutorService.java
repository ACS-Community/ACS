/**
 * Helper class that allows tests (but also other code) to be executed concurrently,

 * all arriving in the smallest possible time window.
 * <p>
 * This class is similar to {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}, 
 * but it synchronizes the actual execution of all threads.
 * Note that the simple creation and starting of threads does not guarantee 
 * that these threads run after {@link Thread#start()} returns.
 * Therefore this class does not support methods such as {@link ExecutorService#execute(Runnable)}
 * which execute one <code>Runnable</code> in one thread independently of the other threads that it runs.
 * <p>
 * An instance is good for only one burst of threads, otherwise IllegalStateException will be thrown.
