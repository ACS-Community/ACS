        checkAndLock checks if the instance is available and create the lock file
        by delegating to self.lock(..).
        
        This method behaves differently if ACS_INSTANCE environment variable is defined or not.
        
        If ACS_INSTANCE is defined then the instance to lock is the one defined by ACS_INSTANCE itself.
        In this case it tries to lock the instance by delegating to self.lock(..).
        The method returns an error if the instance is already locked; otherwise it returns the
        number of the instance locked that in this case is the same of ACS_INSTANCE.
        
        If ACS_INSTANCE is not defined then checkAndLock locks the first available instance by looking
        for the first available lock file in ACSDATA/tmp.
        Running ACS without having defined ACS_INSTANCE is a abnormal situation so this script
        writes a clear message in that case. The reason is that by getting the first available
        instance there is the risk to lock the instance assigned to someone else.
        
        While searching for the first available instance, the script looks for the first available lock file 
        in ACSDATA/tmp. Between the moment it looks for a free instance and the instant when the
        script effectively creates the lock file there is a critical race (i.e someone else
        outside of this script could have locked the instance in the meantime): in that case the
        script returns an error.
        
        In operation it is not mandatory to define the ACS_INSTANCE environmental variable even if
        it is normally set to 0. The script works in that case either because the first 
        available INSTANCE would be 0.
