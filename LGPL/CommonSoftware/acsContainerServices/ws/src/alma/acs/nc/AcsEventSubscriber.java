/**
 * This interface provides an event subscriber, 
 * that can be implemented over Corba NC or over DDS, or even other technologies.
 * <p>
 * Discussion:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>One AcsEventSubscriber object may subscribe to different types of events,
 *       which for a Corba NC is normal, but for DDS requires tricks with topics and partitions.
 *   <li>Alternatively, we could make this class generic and fix a single event type for the entire object (interface),
 *       so that the java compiler would not allow to add a subscription for a different type.
 *   <li>TODO: The declared exceptions must be cleaned up. Rather no generic AcsJException, and no Corba-NC-specific exceptions.
 *       Also, determine which methods should expose IllegalStateException and which not
 *       ({@link #disconnect()}, {@link #resume()} and {@link #suspend()} depend on the current state of the subscriber).
 *   <li>TODO: We need to check if this API actually works for DDS.
 *   <li>An in-memory shortcutting (simulated channel/topic) could be useful, for testing without external processes running.
 * </ul>
