/**
 * Queue for <code>LogRecord</code>s which takes care of dispatching them to a remote log service, 
 * using the one provided in {@link #setRemoteLogDispatcher(RemoteLogDispatcher)}. 
 * <p>
 * Technically this class is not a singleton, but it is foreseen to be used as a single instance.
 * It is thread-safe, so multiple log handlers can submit records.
 * <p>
 * All log records to be sent remotely to the central log service must be submitted
 * to the {@link #log(LogRecord)} method.
 * If the remote log service is not available (e.g. during startup, or later temporarily due to network problems),
 * the log records will be cached. 
 * The cache size is given by {@link #MAX_QUEUE_SIZE}.
 * If the cache is more than 70% full, the <code>log</code> method will only accept records with level <code>INFO</code> or higher.
 * If the cache is full, no records are accepted. The idea is to not jeopardize the running system, but rather stop remote logging.
 * <p>
 * The queue sorts log records by their log levels and thus dispatches the most important records first,
 * using {@link LogRecordComparator}. <br>
