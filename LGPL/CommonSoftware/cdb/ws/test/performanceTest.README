================
Running the test
================

To run the performance tests for the CDB you should follow the next steps:

 * Open two terminals
 * In one terminal, change to the present directory and execute the cdbjDAL for
   the CDB-MIX CDB:

    $> export CDB=$PWD/CDB-MIX
    $> cdbjDAL

 * You can optionally supress the (huge) output of cdbjDAL by doing:

    $> cdbjDAL &> /dev/null

 * In the second terminal run the test:

    $> make clean all
    $> acsStartJava junit.textui.TestRunner alma.acs.cdb.tests.PerformanceTest

 * The results will be printed in the screen once they are calculated

Expected results
================

In

http://jira.alma.cl/browse/COMP-3789

you will find the results that have been collected by this test for the current
CDB implementation. You should refer to them to check if the implementation of
the CDB that you are using is better or worse than previous ones
