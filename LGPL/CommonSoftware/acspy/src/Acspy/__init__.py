'''
The Acspy package contains 90% of all ACS Python code. The subpackages
here contain APIs to:
- connect to components
- connect to standard CORBA services
- create components
- access notification channels
- access the ACS logging service
- etc

Basically everything that can be found in the C++ and Java APIs
can also be found here. The big exception to this is there no
XML support at the moment.
