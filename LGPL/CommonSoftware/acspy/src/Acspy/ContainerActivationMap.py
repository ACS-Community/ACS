    ContainerActivationMap remembers which components the container is 
    activating/deactivating.
    
    The purpose of this class is to avoid that concurrent calls at least 
    -activate the same component at the same time.
    -de-activate the same component at the same time.
    -one activate a component that another calling is de-activating
    
    The container registers in this class the name of the component
    it is activating or deactivating.
    If the same component is being activated or deactivated by another
    thread then the container waits until the activation/deactivation
    terminates and try again.
    The container notifies when a component has been activated or
    deactivated.
