 * CORBA structured events to a given channel. Instances of Supplier can contact the notification
 * service using the Container, a SimpleClient, and various other means using the numerous
 * constructors provided. 
 * 
 * For those who "know what they're doing", Supplier can be used 
 * directly in lieu of the SimpleSupplier class to publish <b>entire</b> CORBA structured events 
 * (see the publishEvent() methods). This functionality should be used with extreme caution
 * if used at all.
