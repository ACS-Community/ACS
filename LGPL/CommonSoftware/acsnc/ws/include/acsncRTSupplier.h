 *  RTSupplier is used to publish data onto a notification channel

 *  publishData method merely save the structured event to an internal
 *  queue and the event will be sent across the network by a low-priority 
 *  thread sometime later. In summary, it's safe to call publishData
 *  from real-time code as it does not block until the event has been 
 *  received on manager's host.
 *
 *  TODO:
 *  - override the configQofS and configAdminProps methods for 
 *    real-time use
 *  - performance tests
 *  - integrate this class with the ACS Exception Manager because 
 *    asynchornous exceptions can be thrown by the static worker
 *    method
 *  - investigate whether a mutex is really needed for std::queues
 *    in gcc 3.3.
