 *
 * To begin consuming data, simply invoke the consumerReady method. After
 * that, the eventHandlerFunction will be invoked asynchronously each 
 * time an event is received.
 * 
 * TODO:
 * - add a check on the datatype in push_structured_event
 * - support subscriptions to multiple event types...may not be feasible
