This tool is currently under development.

TODO:
-----
 - try to improve a flag hadler to work with separated flags, like: -r -v
 - Documentation (user and maintenance manual)
 - comment or suggestions to improve the reference documents.


NOTE: For this application, Xerces is needed. It is now packaged in a separate module,
so it depends on ACS/LGPL/Tools/extjars and ACS/LGPL/Tools/xercesj.


USAGE:
------
        #java cdbChecker.CDBChecker XMLPath XSDPath
		
	Flags:
		-v     Verbose output
	        -r     Disable the recursively look of .xsd and .xml files feature
	        -n     Get required schemas from the network
				      
          XMLPath and XSDPath can have multiple paths separated by ":".
	  The paths must be absolute (i.e. starting with '/')
          The checker will search for files recursively inside the given paths.


NOTE: With the -n option, schema files are downloaded into a temporary
      directory, to be used by the tool. This files are only used for this
      instance, since these files are deleted after the tool finished.


Examples:

cdbChecker -v $ACSDATA/config/defaultCDB/ \
              $ACSDATA/config/defaultCDB/:$ACSROOT/config/


Now, enjoy the tool.
