/**
 * This class gets registered as an extension property in plugin.xml, 
 * see http://www.vogella.com/articles/Eclipse4LifeCycle/article.html.
 * It can handle application start and stop events.
 * <p>
 * Annotations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>PostContextCreate</code> Is called after the Applications IEclipseContext is created, can be used to add objects, services, etc. to the context. 
 *       This context is created for the MApplication class.
 *   <li> <code>ProcessAdditions</code> Is called directly before the model is passed to the renderer, can be used to add additional elements to the model.
 *   <li> <code>PostStartup</code> Is called right before the  is fired.
 *   <li> <code>ProcessRemovals</code> Same as <code>ProcessAdditions</code> but for removals.
 *   <li> <code>PreSave</code> Is called before the application model is saved. You can modify the model before it is persisted.
 * </ul> 
 * See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=376821 about listening for UI event "org/eclipse/e4/ui/LifeCycle/activate" (UIEvents.UILifeCycle.ACTIVATE),
 * as there is no <code>PostStartup</code> annotation for this lifecycle manager.
