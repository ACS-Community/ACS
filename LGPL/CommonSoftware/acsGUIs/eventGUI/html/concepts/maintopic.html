<h1>Event GUI Overview</h1>
The eventGUI is intended as a replacement for the Python-based acseventbrowser,
which has shown stability problems in the past. The new, Eclipse RCP (Java) based
eventGUI does not include all the functionality that was offered by its
predecessor, but should be easier to use and understand.

There are three principal views:
<h2>Service Summary View</h2>
This hierarchical view displays high-level information concerning each of the instances of
the CORBA Notify Service that are currently running under ACS. At the time
of writing, these are:
<ol>
<li><b>Default Notify Service</b>: used by subsystems for event communication</li>
<li><b>Logging Notify Service</b>: currently carries logs across the network</li>
<li><b>Archiving Notify Service</b>: carries those BACI properties for which it is enabled in the (TM)CDB</li>
</ol>
The leaves of the explorer-like tree show the number of consumers and the number of
suppliers for each of these Services. When monitoring is enabled (right-click
anywhere on the View and select "Start monitoring"), the recent (within the last
10 seconds) increase or decrease in the number of suppliers/consumers will be
shown next to the totals.
<h2>Channel Tree View</h2>
<h2>Event List View</h2>
Clicking on an event in this view will open the
<h3>Event Detail View</h3>
This view (still somewhat of a work in progress) displays the decoded contents
of the selected event. In the case of an event that contains one or more
arrays, only the first 5 elements of the array will be shown.

Note that for large events, <I>e.g.</I>. with thousand-element arrays, display
of the event may take some time, as indicated by a rotating cursor.
