DAO implementations are tied to the LaserComponent component:
 * The ConfigurationAccessor can't use directly the DAL, it needs the
   ContainerServices
 * Exception types used by the DAOImpls should be less generic, and reflect
   with more detail why are they occurring, not just a string.
 * There is no AlarmSystemConfigurationDAO (nor its implementation).
 * ACSSourceDAOImpl should load the sources from the CDB, not as parameter,
   and use the Source class to store them.

Check out which types should be used. There are several objects that seems
to be quite similar:
 * alma.acs.alarmsystem.generated.*
 * alma.alarmsystem.alarmmessage.generated.*
 * com.cosylab.acs.laser.dao.xml.*
 * cern.laser.business.data.*
