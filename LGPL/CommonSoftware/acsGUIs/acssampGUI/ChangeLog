	  selected

2009-05-05 18:00  rtobar

	* Added missing image for StatusIcon
	  There was a JPanel inside another, which was unnecessary. Deleted
	  external one,
	  and using directly the internal

2009-05-05 00:10  rtobar

	* Status Icon in Plotting Window

2009-05-04 23:40  rtobar

	* Filename given to user corresponds to the actual filename where
	  the data is dumped

	  sampling manager
	  Added tests to check the good behaviour of this schema
	  Added non-existen sampling manager, test added for this case

2009-05-04 19:20  rtobar

	* Check if the Sampling Manager is available, and notify it with

	  GUI

2009-05-04 04:53  rtobar

	* Organizing imports

2009-05-04 04:44  rtobar

	* Text fields are 3 columns wide

2009-05-02 01:50  ntroncos

	* Fix problem when starting a sample in an unreachable acssampl
	  component.
	  The issues if by any chance the acssamp componen is no longer
	  available
	  the gui would just spit out a back trace "start" and empty plot
	  and
	  give no feeback to the user.
	  Fixes:
	  samplingSystemUI/core/SamplingManager.java
	  The problem was in this file. I was doing a catch (Exception)
	  printing out and doing nothing else. I must have been insane
	  when i wrote this.
	  Now it does proper handling and throwing. This triggered a
	  cascade of fixes in other files.
