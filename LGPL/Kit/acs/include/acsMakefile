#   NAME
#   acsMakefile - system wide make definitions for ALMA SW
# 
#   DESCRIPTION
#   
#   acsMakefile sets common definitions that are valid for the whole 
#   ACS based software. It also finds out on which platform and which 
#   operating system the software is being built on and sets variables 
#   accordingly.
#   In addition, acsMakefile provides a set of activities normally required 
#   by every module (generation of automatic dependencies, clean, man pages,
#   install). The scope of such standard actions is controlled by the
#   calling Makefile via a set of variables (see Makefile for more).
#
#   This file shall be included by each Makefile used to build any piece
#   of an ACS based software.
#
#   The variables set by acsMakefile depends on the value of some
#   shell-environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT) and on the operating 
#   system (type and version). Make defaults can apply as well.
#
#   By default acsMakefile works for UNIX files. If the make variable
#   MAKE_VXWORKS is defined, acsMakefile works to produce VxWorks applications.
#   
#   In general, for any given <TAG> supported by the acsMakefile, and used
#   in the Makefiles as <TAG> = alpha, a set of auxiliary targets are made 
#   available:
#       do_<tag>_alpha
#       clean_<tag>_alpha
#       install_<tag>_alpha
#       clean_dist_<tag>_alpha
#
#   and so are the corresponding cumulative targets:
#       do_<tag>s, clean_<tag>s, clean_dist_<tag>, install_<tag>s.
#                                 
#   The association <TAG> to <tag> is listed here:
#
#     SCRIPTS 		script
#     ACSLOGTSDEF 	logts
#     XSDBIND 		xsdbind
#     ACSERRDEF 	xmlerr
#     IDL_FILES 	idl
#     JARFILES 		java
#     DDS_FILES 	dds
#     LIBRARIES 	lib
#     EXECUTABLES 	exe
#     PY_PACKAGES 	python_package
#     PY_MODULES 	python_module
#     PY_SCRIPTS 	python_script
#     PANELS 		panel
#     TCL_SCRIPTS 	tcl_script
#     TCL_LIBRARIES 	tcl_lib
#     RTAI_MODULES 	rtai
#     KERNEL_MODULES 	kernel_module
#
#   If the building of one specific part of the module is desired, 
#   the above targets may be used in conjunction with overriding the 
#   module's Makefile's variables from the command line.
#
#   For instance:
#     make JARFILES=MyJar do_javas
#     make LIBRARIES=MyLibrary do_libs
#
#   The correct dependency relationships must be fullfilled for the partial
#   system to build.
#
#   In detail, acsMakefile provides the definition of the following variables:
#
#   SHELL     the shell used to interpret the commands
#             RULE: /bin/sh   (force Bourne shell)
#
#   CC        compiler to be used
#
#   CFLAGS    compilation flags
#             RULE: a basic default is provided and, if needed, modified 
#                   according to os/version:
#
#                   - UNIX (both HP and SUN): 
#                       
#                     CC     = gcc -ansi
#                     CFLAGS = -Wall -Wundef -Wpointer-arith -Wconversion \
#                              -Wsign-compare -Wwrite-strings             \
#                              -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes   \
#                              -Wmissing-declarations $(OPTIONS) 
#
#                    - VxWorks (CPU= MC68000|MC68040|PPC604):
#                         CPU     VX_CPU_FAMILY  CPU_CFLAGS
#                         MC68000       68k      -DCPU=MC68000 -m68000  
#                         MC68040       68k      -DCPU=MC68040  
#                         PPC604        ppc      -DCPU=PPC604  
#
#                      CC     = cc$(VX_CPU_FAMILY) -ansi -fno-builtin -nostdinc
#                      CFLAGS = $(CPU_CFLAGS) -Wall -Wundef -Wpointer-arith \
#                               -Wconversion -Wsign-compare -Wwrite-strings \
#                               -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes    \
#                               -Wmissing-declarations -c $(OPTIONS) 
#                                             
#             For both, the compilation options controlling optimization
#             and debugging information generation are generated as follows:   
#
#                                                   $(OPTIONS) 
#                  
#                     default    UNIX:           -O    -g -DDEBUG
#                             VxWorks:                  -DDEBUG
#
#                          DEBUG='on'                  -g -DDEBUG
#
#     
#                          OPTIMIZE='on'         -O                 
#
#                          OPTIMIZE=<n>          -O<n>              
#                             <n>=[0|1|..|9]
#
#             If more than one variable are defined, the precedence is:
#             DEBUG, OPTIMIZE
#
#             If defined, USER_CFLAGS are added to CFLAGS.
#
#   C_PLUS_PLUS_FLAGS  C++ compilation flags
#   CCDEP     compiler used to extract automatic dependencies (gcc -MM -ansi)
#
#   SEARCHPATH basic search path, set to MODROOT:INTROOT:INTLIST:ACSROOT
#             whereby the directories in INTROOT, INTLIST and ACSROOT will
#             have "/vw" appended to them if MAKE_VXWORKS is set. MODROOT will
#             be set to ".." if the environment variable MODPATH is set to 1;
#             otherwise it will not be part of SEARCHPATH.
#   ACSINC    ACS includes  (integration area, if defined, and then root)
#   ACSLIB    ACS libraries (integration area, if defined, and then root)
#   XINC      X11  includes
#   XLIB      X11  libraries
#   VXINC     VxWorks includes
#   VXLIB     VxWorks libraries
#             RULE: use os/version/machine depending values, or
#                   empty otherwise.
#
#   I_PATH    complete search path for include files
#   L_PATH    complete search path for libraries 
#             Each variable is build as an ordered list od directory 
#             prefixed by -I or -L and followed by /include or ../lib (or LIBDIR)
#             as appropriate. The directory used are:
#
#               - for UNIX applications:
#                   - the current module (..) 
#                   - user defined (USER_INC or USER_LIB).
#                   - the integration (INTROOT)
#                   - the additional integration areas (INTLIST)
#                   - ACS root
#                   - X11      (XINC  or XLIB)
#
#               - for VxWorks applications:
#                   - the current module (..) 
#                   - if exists, the ws-part of the module (../../ws) 
#                   - user defined (USER_INC or USER_LIB).        (*)
#                   - the integration (INTROOT/vw)                (*)
#                   - the additional integration areas (INTLIST)  (*)
#                   - ACS root (ACSROOT/vw) 
#                   - VxWorks  (VXINC or VXLIB)
#                (*) includes are searched in both the "vw/include/" 
#                    and "include/" directories
#
#   AR        archive maintaining program
#
#   SHLIB_EXT extention for shared libraries: "sl" on HP, "so" for Sun

#   RANLIB    program to update Archive Symbol Directory (__.SYMDEF)
#
#   RM        shell commands to delete files or directory (rm -rf)
#
#   WISH      default tcl/tk shell (wish -f)
#
#   TCL_CHECKER default syntax checker for tcl/tk files (tclCheck)
#
#   LASTCHANGE the version identifier to label man pages
#             RULE: "MODVERSION d/m/y-H:M" if MODVERSION shell-variable defined,
#                   "development d/m/y-H:M" otherwise
#
#   PRJTOP    prefix directory for "install" operations
#             RULE: set to either INTROOT(/vw) or ACSROOT(/vw), if defined,
#                   left undefined otherwise.
#   INSTALL_ROOT  set to either INTROOT or ACSROOTif
#   INCLUDE   target directory for installing .h files    $(PRJTOP)/include
#   BINDIR    binary directory: bin for WSs, bin/$CPU for LCUs
#   BIN       target directory for installing bin files   $(PRJTOP)/$(BINDIR)

#              (*) is PRJTOP without /vw because these files are 
#                  valid only at workstation level
#
# 
#     REMARK: if you do not like the value provided either by acsMakefile
#             or by make itself, you can still override each variable using
#             the assignement at command line level:
#
#             Example:      make CC='cc' CFLAGS='-g' 
#
#   IDL
#
#   IDL files specified with the directive IDL_FILES are
#   passed to the three CORBA compilers for stubs and skeletons
#   generation.
#   These are:
#
#      JacORB   for Java
#      ACE/TAO  for C++
#      OMNIORB  for Python
#   
#   Each of the files specified in IDL_FILES is passed to the three
#   CORBA compilers in turn, and in addition to the ALMA XmlIdl compiler, 
#   if the XML_IDL variable is set.
#   
#   The IDL_FILES are intended to be either IDL files (extension .idl) or
#   IDL files containing only Macros (extension .midl)
#
#   The stubs and skeletons for C++ are stored in the object directory.
#   The C++ Stubs will be compiled and put in a library called 
#   ../lib/lib<idl>Stubs.a
#   
#   Additional libraries for the C++ stubs can be provided by specifying
#   the tag  <idl>Stubs_LIBS = <lll>
#
#   The Java files are directly compiled and jarred in a jarfile
#   with the same name under lib, the source and class files deleted.
#
#   Generated Python files go into lib/python/site-packages.
#
#   The directive COMPONENT_HELPERS is a flag to specify whether
#   component helper classes for Java have to be generated.
#   Any non null value will trigger this behaviour.
#
#   Setting COMPONENT_HELPERS also implies ALMA XmlIdl compilation 
#   (i.e. XML_IDL is set automatically to "NOTUSED").
#
#   The 'clean' target takes care of deleting all generated files.
#
#   Also, IDL files specified in the ABEANS variable are used with the
#   ACS Beans generator and produce jarfiles in ../lib.
#   These are installed by the install target and cleaned by the clean target.
#
#   Files with the extension .midl are pre-processed with cpp and saved as .idl
#   The variable $(MIDL_FLAGS) is used to pass definitions to the pre-processor
#   Pragma instructions are passed over as they are (see JacPrep for details).
#
#
#   RTAI
#
#   The acsMakefile handles the targets to make, install and clean 
#   RTAI kernel modules code.
#   
#   The main variable to be defined in the Makefile is RTAI_MODULES.
#   It behaves similarly to the EXECUTABLES or LIBRARIES variables,
#   and allows the customary specification of object files, compiler and
#   linking options.
#
#   For RTAI modules to be build, installed or cleaned, the environment 
#   variable  RTAI_HOME must be defined.
#
#   To customize compiling options USER_RTAI_CFLAGS can be used.
#   Also available is the tag RTAI_MODULES_L which keeps the modules local
#   without installing them.
#   The clean target deletes all files from rtai directory
#
#   Support for modules load/unload:
#
#   for each module listed in RTAI_MODULES or RTAI_MODULES_L, 
#   the makefile assumes
#   the existence of two corresponding C++ files called 
#   load<LKM>.cpp and unload<LKM>.cpp
#
#   These files are built into two binaries.
#   Also, an additional script called "installLKM" is built, which contains 
#   instructions on how to copy the LKM into the suitable system directories 
#   and makes the load/unload binaries setuid root.
#   This script must be executed as root.
#
#   KERNEL MODULES
#
#   The acsMakefile handles the targets to make, install and clean 
#   standard Linux kernel modules code.
#   
#   The main variable to be defined in the Makefile is KERNEL_MODULES.
#   It behaves similarly to the EXECUTABLES or LIBRARIES variables,
#   and allows the customary specification of object files, compiler and
#   linking options.
#
#   For kernel modules to be build, installed or cleaned, the environment 
#   variable LINUX_HOME must be defined.
#
#   To customize compiling options USER_KERNEL_MODULE_CFLAGS can be used.
#   Also available is the tag KERNEL_MODULES_L which keeps the modules local
#   without installing them.
#   The clean target deletes all files from the kernel subdirectory.
#
#   Support for modules load/unload:
#
#   for each module listed in KERNEL_MODULES or KERNEL_MODULES_L, 
#   the makefile assumes
#   the existence of two corresponding C++ files called 
#   load<LKM>.cpp and unload<LKM>.cpp
#
#   These files are built into two binaries.
#   Also, an additional script called "installLKM" is built, which contains 
#   instructions on how to copy the LKM into the suitable system directories 
#   and makes the load/unload binaries setuid root.
#   This script must be executed as root.
#
#   PYTHON
#
#   1.PY_SCRIPTS and PY_SCRIPTS_L: These
#     scripts, specified without the .py extension, will be copied to the
#     local bin directory of the module. make install copies them to the
#     $INTROOT/bin. No further handling is done. As for any generic script, 
#     the PY_SCRIPTS_L are not installed by make install 
#
#   2.PY_MODULES:
#     These scripts, specified without the .py extension, will be copied 
#     to the local  lib/python/site-packages/module directory. Notice that 
#     they are scripts, not directories. 
#
#   3.PY_PACKAGES:
#     Packages specified in here must be under the corresponding directory 
#     under src. They are copied to the local lib/python/site-packages/package 
#
#   JAVA
#
#   The acsMakefile handles the targets to make, install and clean 
#   Java code (all files in the src directory of a software module 
#   with extension .java)
#
#   All the files .java are compiled calling the Java compiler. 
#   The resulting .class files are put in the ../object directory.
#   Afterwards, all the files .class existing in the ../object 
#   directory are combined in one or more  JAR archive files which are
#   created in the ../lib directory. 
#   
#   The "make install" will copy this jar file under the lib 
#   directory of the installation root (INTROOT, ACSROOT...)
#
#   The names of the jar files are determined by the user who will 
#   have to define in the module's Makefile the variable: 
#   JARFILES = <jjj1> <jjj2> .... (without extension .jar)
#   (name of the resulting jar files without extension)
#   plus corresponding directories in the form of
#   <jjj1>_DIRS = <dir11> <dir12> ... (space separated)
#   <jjj2>_DIRS = <dir21> <dir22> ...
# 
#   Additional non java files can be added specifying the directories they
#   are in, relative to the module src directory, in the following form:
#   <jjj>_EXTRAS = images
#
#    or
#
#   <jjj>_EXTRAS = sounds/rock/queen.au sounds/classic/Beethoven.au
#
#   Dependencies across jarfiles may be specified using the
#   <jjj>_JLIBS = someOtherJar  
#   construct, since acsMakefile does not have the capability to automatically
#   infer dependencies. Adding such dependency information is a precondition
#   to parallel make execution.
#
#   Compiler options to the javac compiler can be passed by setting the
#   USER_JFLAGS and <jjj>_JFLAGS.
#
#   A single Jarfile may require to use the 'endorsed' behaviour, in which case
#   <jjj>_ENDORSED="on" can be used.
#
#   The above featuers can also be used for jarfiles listed in the tag
#   COMPONENTS_JARFILES, which is used to single out jarfiles which act as ACS
#   components and therefore follow a somewhat special treatment.
#   In particular, they are not installed straight under lib, but under
#   lib/ACScomponents
#
#   Notice   that   a jarfile may   be listed  in   either   JARFILES or 
#   COMPONENTS_JARFILES but not in both
#
#   The CLASSPATH variable is generated by a custom script. 
#   It takes the initial value of CLASSPATH from the shell and augments it 
#   with all jarfiles contained in <module>/lib, $INTROOT/lib and 
#   $ACSROOT/lib, in that sequence. 
#   If the script is called with the -components option, only the directories
#   containing ACS components jarfiles are returned.
#
#   Java byte compiled code goes under <module>/object, possibly 
#   under a directory structure reflecting the Java package 
#   structure. Jarfiles are created, as specified in the JARFILES 
#   variable and moved to the lib directory.
#
#   The DEBUG flag can be set, to make original Java files to be appended
#   in the jarfile.

#
#   ENVIRONMENT  
#   The following variables, if defined either in the environment or by the
#   calling Makefile, can control acsMakefile 
#
#     GNU_ROOT     where to look for GNU stuff. NO DEFAULT!
#     TCLTK_ROOT   where to look for TCL/TK stuff. NO DEFAULT!

#     MAKE_VERBOSE if defined all commands are printed, by default only the
#                  relevant (compilation) ones are printed
#     MAKE_NOSHARED if defined, shared libraries are not used. The actual
#                  behaviour is platform dependent.
#     CC           if defined can force the usage of a specific compiler.
#     CPU          (mandatory for LCU) cpu type
#     MAKE_PURIFY  if defined executable are created in a Purify'd way

#     MAKE_PURECOV if defined executable are instrumented for test coverage
#     MAKE_ALL_WARNINGS if defined all compiler warnings are activated
#     ACSROOT      ACS Software root directory

#     INTLIST      ":"-separated list of Auxiliary Integration areas. If defined, 
#                  are used to build include and lib search paths.
#                  Used ONLY if INTROOT is defined!
#     USER_CFLAGS  list of additional C compilation flags
#     USER_INC     list of additional include files  (formated as  -I<dir> ... )
#     USER_LIB     list of additional libraries      (formated as  -L<dir> ...)
#     XINC         X11 includes  
#     XLIB         X11 libraries
#     WIND_BASE    root directory for WINDRIVER VxWorks TORNADO product 
#     MODVERSION   version identification
#
#   CAUTION
#   The variables defined by acsMakefile should not be redefined inside 
#   a Makefile. If you need to do that, clearly comment the rational behind.
