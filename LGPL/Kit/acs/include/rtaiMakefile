#   NAME
#   rtaiMakefile - language specific Makefile
#
#   DESCRIPTION
#   The rtaiMakefile handles the targets to make, install and clean 
#   RTAI kernel modules code.
#   
#   The main variable to be defined in the Makefile is RTAI_MODULES.
#   It behaves similarly to the EXECUTABLES or LIBRARIES variables,
#   and allows the customary specification of object files, compiler and
#   linking options.
#
#   For RTAI modules to be build, installed or cleaned, the environment 
#   variable  RTAI_HOME must be defined.
#
#   To customize compiling options USER_RTAI_CFLAGS can be used.
#   Also available is the tag RTAI_MODULES_L which keeps the modules local
#   without installing them.
#   The clean target deletes all files from rtai directory
#
#   Support for modules load/unload:
#
#   for each module listed in RTAI_MODULES or RTAI_MODULES_L, the makefile assumes
#   the existence of two corresponding C++ files called load<LKM>.cpp and unload<LKM>.cpp
#
#   These files are built into two binaries.
#   Also, an additional script called "installLKM" is built, which contains instructions
#   on how to copy the LKM into the suitable system directories and makes the
#   load/unload binaries setuid root.
#   This script must be executed as root.
