# Several of the tests below use tat's "SOURCE" option, which effectively
# executes some TCL-code WITHIN TAT'S NAMESPACE, before the actual test is
# run. This allows of course to set e.g. environment variable that this
# test-program will subsequently see, and this is something many tests
# need. However, after the test-program finishes there is no way to unset
# such variables within tat (via e.g. a second SOURCE option), i.e. the
# following test will end up with a potentially messed up set of environment
# variables, and should in principle rather than assume any default settings
# ensure that it sets the environment vars as needed.
#
# In our case, several of the tests need particular settings for INTROOT,
# INLIST and ACSROOT, to test acsMakefile's behaviour - and it is not always
# easy to undo these settings (and creation of corresponding directories). 
# To deal with this, test #1 will actually back-up the original settings of 
# the environment variables, and all subsequent tests will start off 
# restoring these settings (by source-ing the "acsRestoreEnv.tcl" script). 
# So if you want to execute particular tests only, you have to include always
# test#1 as first test - or you may be in for a few surprises/failures that 
# are not so obvious ...
