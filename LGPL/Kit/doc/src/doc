#   NAME
#   doc - menu driven utility to access VLT Software Documents Area
# 
#   SYNOPSIS
#       doc
# 
#   DESCRIPTION
# 
#   The documents in the VLT Software Documents Archive area are accessible 
#   in READ to everybody and in WRITE to the author of a document.
#   
#   "doc" provides an easy access system to such a structure.
#   The utility is menu driven and the menus are self explanatory.
#   
#   As general rules:
#   
#      - an empty selection (<Enter>) goes one level up
#   
#      - the easiest way to select is to use the mouse cut-paste features:
#           1) possible answers are listed.
#           2) place the cursor at the beginning of your choice
#           3) left-click and move to the end of the line, then release
#              (the best is that you include in your selection also the EOL)
#           4) place the cursor after the prompt (option:) and left-click
#           5) center-click (your selection is typed there, if EOL was 
#              included, the line is also terminated and the utility 
#              executes your choice)
#
#   ARCHIVE STRUCTURE
#
#   The following is the structure of the VLT Software Documents Archive
#   area. It is intended to store files involved in the production of the
#   documentation of the VLT Software and ii does not substitute the VLT
#   Archive. The archive area is under the responsibility of the SCCM.
#   
#   Under the archive root:
#   
#      - a directory for each document. The directory name is the
#        document number.
#      - one or more ASCII file named "index<docGroup>" listing the title and the
#        number of the document available in the archive.
#   
#   Under each document, a "issue_N.M" subdirectory for each official issue.
#   
#   Under each official issue:
#      - "text" directory for the final version of all text and figure files 
#      - one "prep<k>" directory for each intermediate draft. 
#   
#   Each "prep<k>}) collects all files related to the review procedure 
#   (review call, comment list, etc.) and has a "text" subdirectory to store
#   all text and figure files of the draft of the document.
#   
#   REMARK: the use of the the keywords: issue, prep, text is MANDATORY.

#   ADD A NEW DOCUMENT
#   
#   The $VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT directory and the VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/indexN 
#   files are writeble to everybody.
#   
#   To add a document do the following steps:
#   
#     - decide:
#   
#          + to which group the document belongs. Possible groups are listed
#            in the file VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/indexN and displaied at the 
#            beginning. (Please, follow the convention already established,
#            if not other people looking for your document will be confused)
#   
#          + the title of the document
#
#          + the identifier of the document. It should be the document number.
#            If, for some reason, there is not a document number, make an
#            identifier (UPPERCASE). 
#            The docId is used to name the root directory of the document. 
#            
#
#     - edit the file VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/index<docGroup>
#
#            insert a line   <docTitle>. . . . <docId>
#
#            The index<docGroup> files are displaied to user. Please respect the 
#            already existing format. If needed, new layout text can be added. 
#
#            FORMAT:
#              <docId>    [A-Z, 0-9, "-"] and must containing at least one "-"
#              <docGroup> is limited to one digit [0-9, A-Z, a-z]
#
#     - create the document root directory  
#
#                     mkdir VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/<docId>
#
#     - create the document structure 
#
#          1st issue:   mkdir VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/<docId>/issue_1.0
#          1st prep.:   mkdir VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/<docId>/issue_1.0/prep1
#                       mkdir VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/<docId>/issue_1.0/prep1/text
#
#
#   DOCUMENTS LIFE CYCLE
#
#   The normal life cycle of a document is the following (all actions are
#   done under the document/issue directory and are under the responsibility
#   of the author):
#
#     - using a text tools (editor, LaTeX, FrameMaker, xfig, etc) the document 
#       is written. All the related files are in prep/text or subdirectories.
#
#     - the document is distributed for review (prep/reviewCall)
#
#     - comments are collected from the reviewers (prep/XXX.comments) and
#       listed (prep/commentList
#
#     - comments are discussed (either in a meeting or directly) and 
#       according to the final decision (prep/reviewReport):
#
#         - REJECTED: a new preparation is required. 
#           The document directory structure must be updated adding:
#
#            prep.:   mkdir VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/<docId>/issue_1.0/prep<n+1>
#            text :   mkdir VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/<docId>/issue_1.0/prep<n+1>/text
#
#           Files are copied in the new area 
#
#                     cp -R  prep<n>/text  prep<n+1>/text
#           and the cycle restarts from editing.
#
#         - ACCEPTED: the final version is edited according to review outcomes.
#           The document directory structure must be updated adding:
#
#                     mkdir VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT/<docId>/issue_1.0/text
#
#           Files are copied in the new area 
#
#                     cp -R  prep<n>/text  text
#
#           and edited. 
#
#
#     - the original is signed (author, approver, releaser) and with the 
#       distribution list send to the VLT Archive for distribution.
#
#   POSTSCRIPT
#
#   To allow the display of any document, a PostScript version of the whole
#   document, including the figures, and called "Document.ps" should be
#   created in each "issue/prep/text" and "issue/text" directory
#
#   ANONYMOUS FTP
#
#   If appropriate, Document.ps should also be copied into the area
#   accessible by anonymous ftp (currently te1:/home3/ftp/vlt/pub/doc). 
#
#   See /home3/ftp/vlt/pub/doc/README for how to name the file in the ftp area.
#
#   REMARK: technical report and any other document containing confidential
#           information SHALL NOT be made available to ftp access.
#
#
#
#   FILES
#
#       indexGroups      list of available groups.
#       index<docGroup>  list of available documents in group <docGroup>.
#       keyword/$$_<key> temporary file to list documents by keyword.
#
#   ENVIRONMENT
#   
#     VLT_DOCARCHIVE_ROOT  IN  the archive root directory 
#                              This directory MUST be (remotely) mounted by 
#                              by all VLT developemnt computer.
#
#   RETURN VALUES
#
#   CAUTIONS
#
#   The described procedure is not as described in the first version of the
#   Document Review Procedure

#   
#
#   BUGS     
#   1) there are differences in behaviour when it is called from an Hp
#      or from a SUN
#
#   2) the creation of a new document/issue/preparation should be more 
#      interactive.
#
#   3) As ERIC (the profet of the new religion) has some time to explain me
#      a bit of Tk/Tcl (you know, I'm quite ignorant and I need a good teacher)
#      I'll provide a nicer graphical interface.
#
#   REMARK: semantically speaking, the english word "preparation" means the 
#           process of preparing something, not the output of a process.
#           Instead of prep1, prep2, etc, it would have been more correct to 
#           use  draft1, draft2, etc. But for historical reason this term was
#           already in use to identify issues(!). So take it as a contribution
#           to the enrichement of the english language or as a mistake, but 
#           use it.
