1 Scope

  The Toshiba T1950 laptop is intented to be used mainly with FrameMaker
  on  VLT SW documents.

2 Objectives

  With this laptop, any VLT SW team member should be able to transfer
  FrameMaker files between Windows and Unix operating systems back and forth
  so that it is possible at any time to work on a FrameMaker document on the
  laptop or on Unix.
  This document explains how to switch on an off the laptop, use to transfer
  file between Unix and Windows using the floppy disk of an X terminal
  or using ftp on the laptop.

  3.1 Getting started with the laptop
 

  3.1.1 Equipment

      The laptop equipment is made up of:
      - the portable personal computer itself
      - a universal AC adaptor and power cord 
      - a Ballpoint mouse
      - an Ethernet adapter device
  
      The following software is installed on the computer:
      - MS-DOS 6
      - Microsoft Windows 3.1
      - FrameMaker 3.0 
      - PC/TCP 2.3 (UNIX networking)
 
      The following documentation is available:
      - Toshiba T1950 Series User's Manual


  3.1.2 Power Modes
 
      To AC adaptor's output plug must be connected to the socket input
      on the left side of the computer. If you don't use it, the main
      battery is automatically used. 

      To switch the power on, press and hold the big button located on the
      left side on the computer for 2 or 3 seconds. To switch it off,
      do the same.

      The battery indicator flashes orange when the battery charge is low.
      To recharge it, connect the AC adaptor and turn the computer off:
      it will take about 2,3 hours to recharge the battery. Note that the 
      battery is also recharged if the computer is turned on, but very
      slowly (48 hours).
     
      One of the most useful features of the laptop is the AutoResume.
      This feature lets you turn the computer's power off without exiting
      your software application. When you turn the power on again, you can
      resume work where you left off, because the screen display is restored
      as you left it.
      But this feature will not work if the indicator Disk was in use (C or A)
      is on or if the credit card Ethernet Adapter was working.

      The reset button is located next to the power button: use it when
      the computer does not respond to keyboard command. Use a narrow object
      such as the tip of a ball-point pen.

      
  3.2 File transfer WINDOWS/UNIX.

      There are two different ways to transfer files between the laptop
      and a UNIX computer: using th X terminal floppy disk or using ftp
      on the laptop. In both cases:
      - you are asked to use the docUnix2Dos and docDos2Unix utilities in order
      to avoid the file names discrepancies between Dos/Windows and UNIX.
      - use always C:\temp directory to store your private files.

      Basically, docUnix2Dos creates a directory on UNIX ready to be copied on 
      DOS and docDos2Unix, from the copy of the DOS directory on UNIX, creates
      a directory ready to be used on UNIX.

  3.2.1 File transfer using a floppy.

      From UNIX to DOS, follow these steps:

      - get a formatted DOS 3 1/2 diskette (you can also format it with your
        Envizex via your terminal setup: press F12 for two seconds to display
        the configurations screens, click on Options, click on Format Floppy
        and click twice on the format button that matches your media density).
      - insert it into the Envizex floppy disk
      - go to the UNIX directory to be transfered:
        cd <source_dir>
      - execute docUnix2Dos:
        docUnix2Dos
      - create the target directory on the floppy disk:
        mkdir $HOME/floppy/<target_dir>
      - copy the files from the UNIX directory to the DOS directory:
        cp ../<source_dir>.dos/* $HOME/floppy/<target_dir>/.
      - insert the diskette in the laptop floppy disk and copy 
        your files to the temp directory:
        copy a:\<target_dir>\* c:\temp\.  
      	
      From DOS to UNIX, follow these steps:

      - insert a diskette into the laptop floppy disk and copy your files
        to a directory:
        copy c:\temp\* a:\<dir>\.
      - insert the diskette into your Envizex floppy disk and copy the
        DOS directory in the directory created by docUnix2Dos
        ($HOME/<source_dir>.dos):
        cp $HOME/floppy/<dir>/* $HOME/<source_dir>.dos
      - go to the <source_dir>.dos directory
        cd $HOME/<source_dir>.dos
      - get your updated files on UNIX in their original directory:
        docDos2Unix.

      Note that cp -r does not work wit $HOME/floppy; thus, you need to
      use mkdir and cp.

  3.2.2 File transfer with ftp from the laptop

      First connect the Ethernet adapter cable:
     
      - get the Ethernet device and screw it on the parrallel port in the
        back of the laptop
      - connect the Ethernet device to its power cord and then to the
        T connector (one is available in room 334).

      From UNIX to Windows:

      On UNIX, prepare the directory by executing docUNix2Dos on UNIX in 
      the directory you want to tranfer (you have created a <dir>.dos 
      directory on UNIX).

      On Windows, click the Wftp icon in the PC/TCP Winapps window displayed
      just after Windows has started to start ftp:

      - using the Create Local Directory option of the Commands Menu,
        create your document directory on c:\temp\<doc>.
      - go to this directory by clicking on directories in the Local
        System file list
      - open one session with the Open option of the Session Menu: click the
        host from which you want to transfer files (you will be asked for
        your Unix account and password): the Remote System file list now 
        displays your home directory.
      - go to the document directory <dir>.dos you want to transfer by 
        clicking on directories in the Remote System file list.
      - select every file of this directory by pressing the Control key and
        clicking on the file name (you cannot click on a directory and you
        cannot drag the mouse pointer); when every file has been selected,
        click the Copy button: Wftp will ask you to confirm the Windows
        file name for every selected file, since you have used the
        docUnix2Dos utility to avoid file name truncations, click always Yes.
      - close the session with the Close option of the Session Menu: click
        the No button to answer the question "Save session before closing ?"
        (otherwise your name and will be stored with the Session).

      From Windows to UNIX:

      - open one session with the Open option of the Session Menu: click the
        host to which you want to transfer files (you will be asked for
        your Unix account and password): the Remote System file list now 
        displays your home directory.
      - go to the Unix directory created by the DocUnix2Dos command <dir>.dos
        by clicking on directories in the Remote System file list.
      - go to the document directory you want to transfer by 
        clicking on directories in the Local System file list.
      - select every file of the directory by pressing the Control key and
        clicking on the file name (you cannot click on a directory and you
        cannot drag the mouse pointer); when every file has been selected,
        click the Copy button: Wftp will ask you to confirm the Windows
        file name for every selected file, since you have used the
        docUnix2Dos utility to avoid file name truncations, click always Yes.
      - get your updated files on Unix in their original directory by
        executing: docDos2Unix on UNIX from the <dir>.dos directory.
      - close the session with the Close option of the Session Menu: click
        the No button to answer the question "Save session before closing ?"
        (otherwise your name be stored with the Session).x
      - delete your Windows document files by selecting them and clicking
        the Delete button.
     
 
  3.3 Starting FrameMaker

      In the Windows Program Manager window, click the FrameMaker group icon 
      and then the FrameMaker 3.0 icon.
       
      Note that the file Documen_.boo (Document.book on Unix) cannot be used
      on the PC. Edit each file independently.
