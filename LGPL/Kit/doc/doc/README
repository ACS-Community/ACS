		UNIX TO DOS AND DOS TO UNIX FILE TRANFER SCRIPTS

These scripts serve solely the tranfer for FrameMaker documents.

docUnix2Dos
===========

copy one UNIX directory to $HOME/floppy.

The source directory is always the current directory.
	
A directory, named from the basename (path last name) of the chosen directory,
is created in $HOME/floppy. If that directory already exists on the floppy disk
, you are asked another name.
Every file from the chosen directory is copied into this directory with the 
following name conversions:

- UNIX file name can only contain alphanumeric characters, the dot ('.')
  character and the underscore ('_') character, but UNIX filenames which 
  contains several dots or which begin with the dotc character are rejected.
- UNIX file names which are the same when uppercase are rejected
  (a DOS file name is always uppercase).

- otherwise, the DOS file name is built the following way:
  - the 7 first characters are taken from the UNIX name
  if there is a name duplication problem, a character (digit from 0 to 9,
  uppercase letter and lowercase letter is added), otherwise a underscore is 
  concatenated.
  - if there is no UNIX suffix, there is not DOS suffix.
  - if there is a UNIX suffix, it is truncated to the first 3 characters.
  

  Ex.1.: comment_list0 -> COMMENT1
         comment_list9 -> COMMENT2
         conclusions_of_discussion_on_open_points_after_INS_review ->
         CONCLUS_

  Ex.2.: comment_list.doc10 -> COMMENT_.DOC
         comment_list.doc3  -> COMMENT1.DOC
         com.doc3           -> COM.DOC
         test.fm            -> TEST.FM


Note that a child directory, named <basename>.DOS will be created on the 
floppy disk, containing the executed file name conversions.
This directory must not be deleted: it is needed to copy the files from DOS 
to UNIX.


docDos2Unix [<dirname>]
=======================

copy from one DOS directory to a UNIX directory.

The source directory is always the current directory.

<dirname> is the optional parameter for the target directory: if not specified
, the target directory is the one where docUnix2Dos has been executed.

The files, which have been copied from the UNIX directory to the floppy
directory with docCopyFromUnixToDos, are copied to the UNIX directory and
are named with their original UNIX names.

Caution: if there is new file (created on PC), it is just copied, the name is 
not changed.
