#   NAME
#   vltMakeTclScriptDependencies - create the makefile to buid a Tcl/TK script
# 
#   SYNOPSIS
#
#        vltMakeTclScriptDependencies <exeName> <objectList> 
# 
#   DESCRIPTION
#   Utility used by vltMakefile to create the makefile containing the
#   dependencies of a Tcl/Tk script. They are:
#          - each object file (scripts)
#          - the Makefile 
#
#     ../bin/<exeName>: ... <obj-i>.tcl 
#     <TAB>  -vltMakeTclScript $(WISH) $(<exeName>_TCLSH) 
#                              <exeName> $(<exeName>_OBJECTS) $(<exeName>_LIBS)
#
#   The rules is written to standard output.
#
#   <exeName>     The name of the target. The file is ../bin/<exeName>
#
#   <objectList>  The list of the script files in the src/ directory.
#                 (Without neither directory nor .tcl suffix)
#
#   <tclLibList>  the list of tcl libraries needed to link.
#                 the library directory name is created as
#                 lib<listMember>.tcl
#
