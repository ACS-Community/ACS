The following scripts are used to get all the necessary services
running prior to running the JMeter tests. More detailed information 
about how to run the tests can be found in:
../../../JMeter/doc/DOC-ACS_Performance_Test.html

****************************************************************************
WARNING: If you choose not to do a full CVS checkout (followed by a make and then followed by running the deployment script (../../../JMeter/build script)
on one or more of the machines in a multi-computer test environment, be aware 
that you will need to manually perform the same steps that the build script 
performs, for each JMeter installation; if you choose not to do it from the CVS 
checkout/make/build process, and instead decide to copy files by hand,
look carefully at what needs to be done (by examining the 
build script). If any of the files that are installed by the build script
are missing for any of the machines in your test environment, it will fail!
****************************************************************************

A short description of each script follows:

distsync-server $host	Starts distsync server connected to rmiregistry running
			on $host. Normally this is the same computer on which
			you run the script, however use the actual ip address 
			and NOT localhost or 127.0.0.1 here.
			You will also need to specify this (same) IP address 
			in acsperftests.jmx's DISTSYNC_SERVER variable.
jmeter-server		Slightly modified version of jmeter-server that allows
			both DistSync and jMeter's server to run on the same
			machine (sharing the same rmiregistry).
start-rmiregistry	Starts rmiregistry with properly constructed CLASSPATH.
			This script is used by the above scripts.
stop-rmiregistry	If rmiregistry was not closed properly, it might 
			cause some problems the next time you want to use either
			of these services. If so, you can stop the rmi 
			registry by running this script. All it really does is 
			'killall rmiregistry'.

Use the acsperftests.jmx test suite with jMeter to perform most of the acstests.

When all tests are done, you can use JMeterToCSV.pl script to convert the
collected data into CSV format, which can then be further analyzed with a
spreadsheet tool like OOCalc.
