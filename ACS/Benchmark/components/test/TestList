# Format of remaining lines in this file:
#   <testNr> <testName> <prog 1> [<prog 2>..<prog n>]
# with
#   <testNr> the integer number assigned to the test. Usually
#         every record has a different number so that they can
#         be executed individually.
#   <testName> a symbolic name used to identify the test.
#   <prog 1>...  a list of programs to be executed in order to
#         perform the test. It is required to have at least one
#         program. All programs in the list are executed in the
#         background, except the last one, which is executed
#         in the foreground. To pass parameters to a program
#         it is enough to write the complete command line for
#         the program in quotes.
