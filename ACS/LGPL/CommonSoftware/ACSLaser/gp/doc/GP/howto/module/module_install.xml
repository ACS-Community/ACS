		<title>Installing the GP and logging modules</title>
		<description>
			<p>This document describes how to install the GP and logging modules in NetBeans. 
			You might have to <A href="CleaningUpLibExt.html">clean up the lib/ext directory</A>, 
			if you have added your own jars to the <code>lib/ext</code> directory following the 
			temporary instructions given in the GP course. </p>
			<p>The GP.jar and logging.jar are now contained in NetBeans modules, so-called <code>.nbm</code> files </p>
			<p>To install them, please proceed as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Download both the GP.nbm and logging.nbm files from the GP <a href="../../proj-gp/download/index.html">download page</a> 
				and store them somewhere e.g. in your <code>c:\temp\</code> directory. (Please note that you cannot install GP.nbm without logging.nbm)</li>
				<li>Start the NetBeans IDE. If you are already running NetBeans, make sure you have saved all your work.</li>
				<li>Open the menu <code>"Tools=>Update Center"</code>. In the Wizard Window that opens select the Radio button corresponding to 
				"Install Manually downloaded Modules", as shown below. Click the "next" button of the Wizard<p>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Use the "Add" button to select the two nbm files <code>GP.nbm</code> and <code>logging.nbm</code> to the list of modules. 
				Click on "next".</li>
				<li>Now you should see the two modules listed in the upper right Window "Include in Install", as shown below. Click on "next".<p>
						<img border="0" src="images/module_install_wizard3.jpg" width="781" height="538"/>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>The 3rd window shows the download process, which is immediate, given the fact that the files are already on your hard disk. 
				Click "next".</li>
				<li>On the last window (c.f. below), tick the checkbox "Include" for both modules, do <em>not</em> tick the checkbox "global". 
				NetBeans will warn you about "unsigned modules" and ask you whether you want to install them anyway. Click on "Yes". 
				Your window should then look as shown below. <p>
						<img border="0" src="images/module_install_wizard5.jpg" width="780" height="535"/>
					</p>
					<p>Click on "Finish" to install the modules. NetBeans asks you if you want to restart the IDE, or install later. 
					Tick the "restart" checkbox and click on "OK". </p>
				</li>
				<li>Once NetBeans has started up again, you can check whether the Modules have really been installed. 
				Use the "Tools=>Options" menu, and in the options window open the branch "Options=>IDE configuration=>System=>Modules". 
				You should see, among many other modules, the two entries "GP Layer" and "CERN Logging".</li>
			</ul>
