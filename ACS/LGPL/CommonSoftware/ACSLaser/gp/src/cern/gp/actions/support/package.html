Contains base classes that you can inherit from in order to create new actions classes.
<ul>
	<li>inherit from <code><a href="CallableSystemAction.html">CallableSystemAction</a></code> to create context insensitive actions</li>
	<li>inherit from <code><a href="NodeAction.html">NodeAction</a></code> to create context sensitive actions that do not delegate their execution to the beans</li>
	<li>inherit from <code><a href="BeanAction.html">BeanAction</a></code> to create context sensitive actions that delegate their execution to the nodes</li>
	<li>inherit from <code><a href="BeanActionSupport.html">BeanActionSupport</a></code> to create context sensitive actions that delegate their execution to the nodes. The difference with <code>BeanAction</code> is that the <code>performCapability</code> method is already implemented. When inheriting from <code>BeanActionSupport</code>, you just have to pass a capability to the parent constructor. You do not have to implement any method. The method to execute is automatically looked-up from the capability.</li>
</ul>
