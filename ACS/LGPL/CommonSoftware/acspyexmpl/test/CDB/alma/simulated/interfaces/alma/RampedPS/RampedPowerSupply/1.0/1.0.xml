<!-- This XML file provides the partial implementation -->
<!-- of the IDL:alma/RampedPS/RampedPowerSupply:1.0    -->
<!-- interface.                                        -->
<!-- Because of this XML's location within the ACS CDB -->
<!-- (i.e., $ACS_CDB/CDB/alma/simulated/interfaces/*), -->
<!-- this simulated behavior description is generic    -->
<!-- and does not tie into any specific component.     -->
<!-- This makes it useful for defining the behavior of -->
<!-- simulated dynamic components. Also, it is very    -->
<!-- useful when one wants to define a component(s)    -->
<!-- method only once for all occurences of the        -->
<!-- component's type.                                 -->
<!--                                                   -->
<!-- There are several things to take note of here:    -->
<!--   1. Everything defined within XML elements       -->
<!--      consists of Python code. You must obey the   -->
<!--      whitespace rules of Python within these      -->
<!--      elements.                                    -->
<!--   2. Not all methods and BACI properties defined  -->
<!--      in IDL for this component are defined here.  -->
<!--      This is unnecessary as the simulator         -->
<!--      framework will dynamically generate methods  -->
<!--      and properties that have not been defined by -->
<!--      some means available to the end-user.        -->
<!--   3. Implementations of inherited methods defined -->
<!--      in other parts of the CDB will be used where -->
<!--      applicable. In this specific case, see       -->
<!--      $ACS_CDB/CDB/alma/simulated/interfaces/alma/ -->
<!--      PS/PowerSupply/1.0                           -->
<!--   4. With respect to 3., one should also note that-->
<!--      it's perfectly acceptable to override methods-->
<!--      defined within $ACS_CDB/CDB/alma/simulated/  -->
<!--      PS/PowerSupply/1.0                           -->

<!-- All simulated components should be derived from   -->
<!-- the SimulatedComponent XML element                -->
