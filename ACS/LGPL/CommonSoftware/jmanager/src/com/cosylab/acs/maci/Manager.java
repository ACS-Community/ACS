/**
 * Manager is the central point of interaction between the components 
 * and the clients that request MACI services. A Manager is 
 * responsible for managing a domain.	
 * Manager has the following functionality:
 *	<UL>
 *	<LI>It is the communication entry point.</LI>
 *	<LI>It performs as a name service, resolving CURLs into Component references.</LI>
 *	<LI>It delegates the Component life cycle management to the Container.</LI>
 *	<LI>It provides information about the whole domain.</LI>
 *	</UL>
 * 
  * This interface defines a CORBA-independent interface for the Manager.
 * In ACS, the acs.maci.plugManagerProxyImpl class implements the CORBA
 * interface and delegates toan implementation of this Manager class
 *  the real work. 
 * 
 * NOTE: There is no <code>throws RemoteException</code> in the signature of the methods.
