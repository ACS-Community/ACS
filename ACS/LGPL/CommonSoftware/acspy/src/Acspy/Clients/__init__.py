'''
The Clients subpackage exists for one purpose - providing implementations
of the MACI Client IDL interface for Python. Most developers will only care
about looking at the SimpleClient module as it contains the documentation for
PySimpleClient, but the BaseClient module can be quite interesting also. The
final thing to note is developers should also look over the documentation for
the ContainerServices module in the Servants subpackage as PySimpleClient is
derived from an extremely useful class there.
