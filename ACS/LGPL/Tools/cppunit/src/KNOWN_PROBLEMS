There are problems with Solaris.
For some reason I have not be able to identify:

- configure produces wrong substitutions for ranlib: @/bin/true
  I have then passed it by hand as /bin/true in configure_script.

- then the build believes that we cannot handle DLLs and
  include/cppunit/config/SelectDllLoader.h believes that
  CPPUNIT_NO_TESTPLUGIN=1.
  As a consequence PlugInManager is not built.
  But then DllPlugInTester fails to build as well as the tests.
  DllPlugInTester itself has no test on CPPUNIT_NO_TESTPLUGIN and
  therefore there are for sure problem with the cppunit Makefile.

We have to monitor the webpage and see with a next version.
Eventually we should send an email.

In any case, the basic cppunit works and the two tests I have prepared
as examples are OK also on Sun.
