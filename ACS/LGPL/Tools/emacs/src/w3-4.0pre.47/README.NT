ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION FILES

* custom.tar.gz

For older versions of Emacs (pre-20.x), you will need the latest and
greatest versions of the custom and widget libraries.  This is
distributed in a separate tar file to save users time in downloading,
and to ease maintenance of the libraries.


BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

(This is for a Windows 95 or NT system.  For Unix or Unix-like
systems, see the file INSTALL.  For VMS systems, see the file
README.VMS)

1) Make sure your system has enough memory to run Emacs, plus about 1
megabyte to spare.

Building Emacs/W3 requires about 2.8 Mb of disk space (including the
sources).  Once installed, Emacs/W3 occupies about 2 Mb in the file
system where it is installed.

2) You must tell Emacs/W3 where to find the custom/widget packages
that you have installed if you are running Emacs 19.

This is done with the WIDGETDIR environment variable.  Set this to the
directory where the lisp files are, ie:

set WIDGETDIR=c:\users\blort\lisp\custom

3) Run `build.bat' in the top directory of the Emacs/W3 distribution
to finish building Emacs/W3 in the standard way.

4) Add the Emacs/W3 lisp directory to your load-path.  Add the
following line to your .emacs file.

(setq load-path (cons "c:/path/to/w3-x.y.z/lisp" load-path))
(require 'w3-auto)

4) Check the file `dir' in your site's info directory (usually
/usr/local/info) to make sure that it has a menu entry for the
Emacs/W3 info files.
