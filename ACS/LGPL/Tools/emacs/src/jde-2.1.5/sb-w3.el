;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   Speedbar provides a frame in which files, and locations in
;; files are displayed.  These functions provide w3 specific support,
;; showing links and addresses in the side-bar.
;;
;;   To enable, add this to your .emacs file.
;;   (autoload 'w3-speedbar-buttons "sb-w3"
;;             "W3 specific speedbar button generator.")
;;
;;   Load w3-toc to get additional tags which represent the major
;;   headers in a given web page.
;;
;;   This file requires speedbar.

;;; Change log:
;; 0.1   - first revision copied from speedbspec.el V 0.1.1
;; 0.1.1 - Removed dependency on speedbspec
;; 0.2   - T.V.Raman's addition using newer w3, and w3 imenu.
;; 0.2.1 - Added new keymap support
