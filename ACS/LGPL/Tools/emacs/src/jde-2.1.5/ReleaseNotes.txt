This releases incorporates the following changes:

New Features
============

This release:

* Improves applet development support. Specifically, it

  - Adds a menu item and command (jde-db-applet) that runs an applet
    in appletviewer in debug mode.

  - Adds file completion and default-to-last-entry features for
    entering the name of the html document used to run or debug
    an applet (available only with the applet commands not the
    menu items).

  - Adds support for appletviewer's -encoding and -J options.

  - Expands applet section in the JDE User's Guide

* Provides the latest version of the Speedbar.

* Provides the latest version of the BeanShell. The latest version
  removes the requirement to use native threads on Solaris.

* Added default keybindings for the speedbar, interface wizard, and
  other features.

* Implements XEmacs for Windows compatibility changes suggested by 
  the XEmacs development team. Thanks to Andy Piper.

  Thanks to Brian Burton <brian@burton-computer.com>.

* The debugger interface now handle package names with
  underscores (thanks to Brian Burton <brian@burton-computer.com>. 

* The debugger interface now recognizes inner classes.
  (Thanks to Michael Lepore <lepore@process.com>)

* Added JDE->Wizards->Import Class command. This command creates
  an import statement for a specified class at the head of the buffer
  from any point in the buffer.

* Provides more robust error handling for the interface wizard. The wizard 
  no longer kills the bsh when it cannot create an interface. The wizard provides
  meaningfull error messages.

* Provides a set-value function for jde-db-source-directories that appends a slash to
  the end of each path if the path does not already end in a slash.

* Defines a new command, jde-find-class-source, that finds and opens the source file
  for a specified class.

* Improves the regular expression used by jde-db-get-package to ignore tabs at the
  beginning of a line.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed a bug that would prevent the JDE keybindings from being
  set on startup in some circumstances. 
  Thanks to Matthew Moore <matthew.moore@Schwab.COM>.

* Removed two line feeds at the end of make command as they appeared to
  confuse GNU make for NT.

* Fixed Jdb->Print menu item.

* The jde-db-option-properties (-D) option now works.

* Fixed regular expression bug that was causing the jdb package extraction
  code to extract commented-out package statements.
  (Thanks to Frederic Baumann <baumann@ilog.fr>)

* Fixed bug in interface implementation wizard that was causing the
  wizard to fail in some circumstances  to create or expand the 
  implements clause for the class implementing the interface.

* The JDE debugger interface fails to track breakpoints in the source due
  to a bug in jde-db-make-qualified-class-name-regexp.

* The override method wizard fails to find the overriding class when
  the open bracket of the class is not on the same line as the class
  keyword.

* Catch non-existant directory errors when searching for source
  files and packages. Thanks to Thanh Nguyen <Thanh.Nguyen@Eng.Sun.COM>
  for finding and providing a fix for this bug.

* Fixed jde-db-find-file so that it displays an error when it cannot 
  find a file instead of opening an empty source buffer.
