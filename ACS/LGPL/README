INSTALL ACS
------------

To build and install ACS go in the ACSSW-Sources directory:

1) Define the root directory where you want ACS to be installed:
   > export ACSROOT=<ACSROOT path>
   
2) Make sure that INTROOT and ACSROOT point to the same directory
   tree:
   > export INTROOT=$ACSROOT

3) make build

This will eventually rename the ACSROOT directory to keep a backup
copy of a pre-existing installation (watch for disk space or delete
by hand the pre-existing ACSROOT.

For more details on the installation procedure, look at the README
file in the root directory of the ACS Distribution CD or at the ACS
Installation Manual.
