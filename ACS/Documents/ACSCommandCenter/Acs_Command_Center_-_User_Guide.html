<h2>1. <a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<br>
This section describes how to launch Acs Command Center and why you
would want to launch it.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Launching_Command_Center">Launching
Command Center</a></h3>
<br>
Acs Command Center is a tool to start up, manage, and shut down Acs
sessions. It can be launched in two ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>a)</b> via the command "<code>acscommandcenter</code>"
in your (Linux) shell<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Command line options</span>:<br>
<ul>
<li><code>-r | -retrieve | --retrieve&nbsp;
PROJECTFILE</code> <br>
retrieve a project file on startup </li>
<br>
<li><code>-g | -geometry | --geometry&nbsp;
WIDTHxHEIGHT+XPOS+YPOS</code> <br>
set the size and location of the application main window </li>
<br>
<li><code>-x | -noexit&nbsp;&nbsp; |
--noexit&nbsp; </code> <br>
do not exit the Java virtual machine on quit </li>
<br>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commandline
arguments:</span><br>
<ul>
<li><code>PROJECTFILE</code> <br>
retrieve a project file on startup</li>
<br>
<li><code>corbaloc::HOST:PORT/Manager</code><br>
instantly connect to and show details of specified manager</li>
<br>
<li><code>HOST:INSTANCE</code><br>
instantly connect to and show details of specified manager</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>b)</b> via the <a href="http://www.eso.org/projects/alma/AcsWebStart">
Acs Java Web Start</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">[www.eso.org/projects/alma/AcsWebStart]</span>
page. For this, your browser needs to have
a Java Web Start plugin (the integrated help viewer of&nbsp;Acs Command
Center does not have one, in that case please copy the given URL to
your full-featured web browser).<br>
<br>
<br>
To make clear what Acs Command Center can do for you (and what it can't
do), we first look at the general work-flow of an Acs
session. If you have worked with Acs on the command line before,
you will find these steps familiar.<br>
<br>
Generally, a session with Acs consists of <b>four</b>
tasks. We will give an overview here,
and discuss them in more detail in the following sections.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Starting_Acs">Starting Acs</a></h3>
<br>
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1)</strong> Start the
Services and the Manager<br>
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2)</strong> Start one or more
Containers<br>
<br>
The single workers (<i>worker = Service, Manager, or Container</i>)
&nbsp;can be run on one single host (see figure A) or on several
hosts (see figure B). Acs Command Center&nbsp;only
supports scenarios
where
Services and Manager run on the same host.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Running_Clients">Running Clients</a></h3>
<br>
After Acs has been started, you will want to run clients against it.
Such a client can either be something provided by you, or be a
preinstalled
client (Acs comes with various popular and useful clients). These
preinstalled clients can directly be started from within Acs Command
Center through the <a href="#Tools_Menu">Tools Menu</a>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>3)</strong> Run one or more clients<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Stopping_Acs">Stopping Acs</a></h3>
After your work is done, you should shut down all workers in reverse
order.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>4)</strong> Stop the Container(s), the Manager, and
the Services<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>2. <a name="Running_Acs">Running Acs</a></h2>
<br>
Acs Command Center allows for different deployment scenarios, from
simple ones like A to complex ones like B. In
this&nbsp;section, you will learn how both scenarios A and B can be
put into practice following step-by-step instructions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Deployment_Scenario_A">Deployment
Scenario A: Using Localhost mode</a></h3>
In our first deployment scenario (recall figure A), all
workers run on localhost.<br>

<br>
<h4><u>Preparation</u></h4>
To run Acs locally on your machine,you need a&nbsp;native Acs
installation on your machine: Acs
Command Center will use shell and python scripts to run your Acs
installation.<br>
<br>
Make sure "Localhost" is selected in the <code>Common Settings</code>
(<b><font color="#ff0000">1</font></b>).<br>
<br>
Specify the <code>Acs Instance</code> to use (<b><font color="#ff0000">2</font></b>,
see <a href="#Acs_Instance">Acs Instance</a> in the
glossary).<br>
<br>
You need to specify a directory where an Acs configuration database is
located (see also <a href="#CDB">Cdb</a>
in the
glossary).
Since you have a native Acs installation,&nbsp;Acs Command Center
will
attempt to figure out which Cdb to use by looking at the environment
variables <code>$ACS_CDB and </code><code>$ACSDATA.
</code>If
these variables aren't set (for instance because you are running on
Windows), you can manually enter the desired Cdb&nbsp;into the "Cdb
Root Dir" field in the Common Settings section.<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Start</u><br>
</h4>
Press the Acs Suite's play button (<b><font color="#ff0000">3</font></b>),
which will start the Services and the Manager. A progress panel will
come up (see <a href="#Progress_Panel">Progress Panel</a>
in the
glossary for more information).&nbsp;Note that while the progress
panel
is
up, some controls in the user interface are locked. When all steps have
been completed successfully, it will close automatically.<br>
<p>The output of
any Acs-related
action you
trigger can be viewed in its own tab in the log area (<b><font color="#ff0000">L</font></b>, see <a href="#Log_Area">Log Area</a> in
the glossary for more information).
If all goes well, there's no need to pay much attention to these logs.<br>
</p>
The freshly started Manager now appears in the deployment info view (<b><font color="#ff0000">D</font></b>, see <a href="#Deployment_Info_View">Deployment
Info View</a> in the glossary for
more information).<br>
<br>
Ensure you have at least one Container visible on screen (their amount
can be adjusted using the plus and minus buttons on the bottom, <b><font color="#ff0000">C</font></b>). Specify a name
and a type&nbsp;(<b><font color="#ff0000">4</font></b>)
for the
Container, e.g., "frodoContainer" of type <code>java</code>,
then
press play
to start the Container (<b><font color="#ff0000">5</font></b>).<br>
<p class="caution">Note: The Container name you specify
here is used by
the Manager to associate components with the Container. It must
therefore be the same as the name specified in the Cdb for the
component(s) you're interested in working with. For C++, this
traditionally is <i>bilboContainer</i>, for Java <i>frodoContainer</i>,
and
for Python <i>aragornContainer</i>.
</p>
<br>
Acs is now up and running, and clients can be run against it.<br>
To run one or more of the predefined clients, use the Tools menu (see <a href="#Tools_Menu">Tools Menu</a> below). For
some of the tools, you may be asked to provide additional information.<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Stop</u></h4>Press the Containers' stop button (<b><font color="#ff0000">6</font></b>) and then the Acs Suite's stop button (<b><font color="#ff0000">7</font></b>).
This will stop the Container(s), the Manager, and the Services. Once
the Acs Suite has been stopped, the Manager will be automatically
removed from the <a href="#Deployment_Info_View">Deployment
Info View</a>.<br>
<p class="caution">Note: There's an asymmetry in the
behavior of
starting the Acs Suite and stopping the Acs Suite: The first starts the
Services and the Manager, the latter stops the Services, the Manager <b>plus</b> the Containers on your local host.</p>
<br>
Again, all output will
go to the log
area (<b><font color="#ff0000">L</font></b>).
In case of problems you should check there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Troubleshooting</u></h4>
If you encounter problems, e.g., the progress panel presents an error
message, and find the Acs session in an inoperable state, &nbsp;you
can
attempt to terminate it with the kill button (<b><font color="#ff0000">X</font></b>).
Note, however, that this is, as
the name implies, a brute shutdown that may kill the Acs Command Center
as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Deployment_Scenario_B">Deployment
Scenario B: Using Remote mode</a></h3>
<br>
In our second scenario (recall figure B), the workers run distributed
on several separate hosts. To allow for such scenarios, Acs Command Center offers the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote</span> mode.<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Preparation</u></h4>
Acs Command Center can access other hosts
over the network&nbsp;and run Acs on these hosts. This&nbsp;is
similar to <b>Localhost </b>mode&nbsp;above in that
Acs Command Center will use
the same
collection of scripts to run Acs on the remote hosts. This implies that
a native Acs installation must be present on these hosts.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">For accessing the remote hosts, Acs
Command Center supports different&nbsp;variants:<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
a)</span> P<span style="font-style: italic;">latform-independent
ssh</span> is
self-contained within Acs Command Center, and you get it "for free"
without the need to configure anything. However, it&nbsp;only supports
user/password authentication. This means, when you want to start/stop
Acs on a remote host, you have to provide a valid accountname and a
password for the remote host. The platform-independent variant is the
default. Also, please note the following:
<br><ul>
<li>A command executed through ssh doesn't commonly run with the environment
that a login shell gives you. While a login shell usually sources the <code>.bash_profile</code>, a remote
command sources only <code>.bashrc</code>. This may mean the command doesn't find the environment it needs to run.</li>
<li>One possible solution is for you to have <code>.bash_profile</code> as a symbolic link to <code>.bashrc</code>.</li>
<li>However, since the usual setup on Alma machines is to define the environment settings for Acs in
<code>.bash_profile</code> (directly, and by sourcing the Acs bash profile), Acs Command Center will explicitly
source your  <code>.bash_profile</code> before running a command through ssh.</li>
<li>The result is that <code>.bashrc</code> will be sourced first, then <code>.bash_profile</code>,
which may again source <code>.bashrc</code>.</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
b)</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Native
ssh</span>, on the other hand, makes use of an <span style="font-style: italic;">ssh</span> program already
installed on your local system. Thus, it can allow for all features of
your native <span style="font-style: italic;">ssh</span>:
for instance, and foremost, the public-key authentication. That means,
if your native <span style="font-style: italic;">ssh</span>
is configured properly, you wont' be required to provide a password for
the remote host you want to start/stop Acs on.<br>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">ssh</span>
program is available for virtually all platforms (see <a href="http://openssh.org/" target="_blank">http://openssh.org/</a>),
and many systems&nbsp;already have it installed.<br>
Beware: If you use the native variant but you did not configure <span style="font-style: italic;">ssh</span> for public-key
authentication, it will&nbsp;prompt for your password - and that
prompt will be on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">terminal</span>
(xterm, dos box) from which you started Acs Command Center. This
behavior is part of the security concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">ssh</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c)</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Acs Daemons</span>
are processes running on a remote host, typically started at boot-time
but they can as well be started manually. Acs Command Center can talk
to a daemon through the Corba protocol (thus&nbsp;avoiding ssh) and
request it, for example, to start a container. To use this variant
successfully, there must be a daemon running on&nbsp;each remote
host
you want to use.<br>
<ul>
<li>Daemons can be used to start and stop <span style="font-style: italic;">Acs Suite</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">containers</span>. The
"Kill" button and the advanced controls (allowing to start services and
manager separately) will still use ssh.</li>
<li>With daemons, there's no need to specify Username or
Password. Instead,
all Acs processes will run under the account of their respective daemon.</li>
<li>The daemon chooses the Cdb to use (from the $ACS_CDB
variable in its environment).</li>
<li>Only with daemons&nbsp;you can specify Type Modifiers
for a container (in the container's Detail Settings).</li>
<li>The output of Acs workers (= Services, Manager, and Containers) started through daemons will not be
available in the log area (<b><font color="#ff0000">L</font></b>).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>To choose your remote variant, select "Remote" in the&nbsp;<code>Common Settings</code>
(<b><font color="#ff0000">1</font></b>), then select the corresponding entry underneath.<br><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
To continue in Remote mode, make sure "Remote" is selected
in the <code>Common Settings</code> (<b><font color="#ff0000">1</font></b>). As for the local
variant, you should
specify an Acs Instance (<b><font color="#ff0000">2</font></b>).
<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Start</u></h4>
Specify a remote host (e.g., "host1") and user credentials for that
host in the <code>Common Settings</code>. Start the
Services and the
Manager
as described before by pressing the Acs Suite's play button (<b><font color="#ff0000">3</font></b>).<br>
<br>
Use the plus button (<b><font color="#ff0000">C</font></b>)
to ensure
you have at least two Containers available on screen.<br>
<br>
Give the first Container a name, and choose its type (<b><font color="#ff0000">4</font></b>). Then press the
first Container's
configure button (the one labeled with three dots) and specify a host
(e.g., "host2") and appropriate user credentials. <br>
<br>
Do the same for the second Container.<br>
<br>
Finally, press
play (<b><font color="#ff0000">5</font></b>)
to start all Containers in
the order you entered them into the list. To move a Container up or
down within the list, select it by clicking into its name field (<b><font color="#ff0000">4</font></b>) and press the
arrow buttons (<b><font color="#ff0000">C</font></b>).<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Stop</u></h4>
Stop the containers by pressing the stop button&nbsp;(<b><font color="#ff0000">6</font></b>).
Then, shut down&nbsp;the Acs Suite through its stop button (<b><font color="#ff0000">7</font></b>). Please refer to <b>Localhost
</b>mode above
if unsure.<br>
<br>
<h4><u>Troubleshooting</u></h4>
As for the local variants, you can terminate Acs mercilessly through
the kill button (<b><font color="#ff0000">X</font></b>)
if it appears
to hang and alike. Again, note that this will also kill the Acs Command
Center if it is running on the same host.<br>
<br>

<h2>3. <a name="Managing_Projects">Managing
Projects</a></h2>
<br>
All settings you entered (in the <code>Common Settings</code>
section,
in the <code>Containers</code> section, etc.) can be
stored as a <code>Project</code>.
Projects are a neat thing that can save you a lot of typing. Their
usage should be self-explanatory, simply use the <code>Project</code>
menu to create, store, and load projects.<br>
<br>
<p class="caution">Note: Any passwords you enter as part
of user
credentials will not be saved when you store a project. You will have
to reenter them the next time you use the project.</p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;<a name="Extra_Tools">Tools</a></h2>
<br>
<h3><a name="Tools_Menu">Tools Menu</a><br>
</h3>
The Tools menu provides access to several useful tools dealing with Acs
and Corba. They are invoked as separate local processes, in other
words, they must exist as executables on your host.
<br>
<br>
The necessary configuration required by the tools is
automatically derived from your <code>Common Settings</code>
without
further interaction required (still some tools might ask for additional
configuration when you launch them). If you are not satisfied with the
default settings, a custom
configuration for the tools can be defined in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Configure Tools...</span>
dialog.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Tool_Definitions">Tool Definitions</a><br>
</h3>
The tools in the Tools menu are defined in an xml file <code>AcsCommandCenterTools.xml</code>
that AcsCommandCenter reads in on startup.
These definitions can be re-read at run-time. This is done through <span style="font-style: italic;">Expert -&gt; Tools Menu
-&gt;
Replace...</span>
which brings up a file-search dialog to point to a new definition file.
The default definition file contains quite exhaustive documentation in
case you'd like to copy and accommodate it.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Progress Panel &nbsp;shows the

an error occurs, it is also shown in the Progress Panel. Thus,
it will (hopefully) support you in tracking down failures.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Deployment Info View shows
information about an
Acs Manager and its related workers. When you start a Manager via the
Acs Command Center, the Manager is automatically added
to the Deployment Info View.
<br><br>
Still, you can add any Manager manually,
provided you know which host and Acs Instance it runs on. 
Press "Add..." to bring up a dialog that lets you enter the network
address of an existing Acs Manager. Network addresses are understood
in a couple of formats: the easiest being the short notation "host:instance"
(e.g. <i>alma:0</i> for Acs Instance 0 on host alma), or alternatively
a corbaloc (e.g. <i>corbaloc::alma:3900/Manager</i> for Acs Instance 9 on host alma),
or a full Corba IOR (like <i>IOR:&lt;really long hex number&gt;</i>).
<br><br>
The shown information will be refreshed automatically. Be aware that&nbsp;this automatism cannot detect all changes on the
server-side instantaneously, in some situations there may be delays of about 10 seconds or more. To
refresh the display manually, press the "Refresh" button. If, opposed to that, you're overwhelmed with data you can
pause automatic refresh through "Freeze".

To prevent the Java Virtual Machine from running out of memory,
the Log Area allows to restrict the buffer size for each log. It is
recommended to make use of this feature -- note however that the

works properly if its buffer size is "unlimited".&nbsp; The

<h3><a name="Acs_Instance">Acs Instance</a></h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acs allows for more
than one
session to be run on the same machine at the same time; we speak of
multiple Acs instances (currently up to ten). One may think of a
collection of slots on a host, with each one being capable of holding
one Acs instance. If you have special preference on which slot to
occupy &nbsp;(e.g., because you made an agreement with your team
members to avoid clashes),

<h3><a name="CDB">Cdb, Cdb-Root</a></h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cdb (<i>Configuration Database</i>)
contains

is read and published by a server process (Cdb-Dal). In order to be
readable by the server process, the Cdb needs to reside in a filesystem
directory. This directory is called Cdb-Root.<br>
