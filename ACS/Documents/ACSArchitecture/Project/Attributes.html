<H1><A NAME="CommandHandling"></A>Attributes</H1>
<H2>Security</H2>
<P>Security requirements, stated in <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 9.1 Security]</A> are not analyzed in this document, but there is
no indication that they cannot be met with the described
architecture.</P>
<H2>Safety</H2>
<P>Requirement <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 9.2.1.
Safety]</A> does not impose any particular behavior on ACS, since it
states that software based on ACS has no direct responsibility on
human and machine safety.</P>
<P>Software limits will be directly supported in ACS <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 9.2.2. Software limits]</A>. Applications will handle software
limits as alarms on Properties representing the value to be kept
within limit. In a typical case, a value with software and hardware
limits will be handled using a 5-state alarm (normal, high/low SW
limit, high/low HW limit). Reaching a software limit will trigger a
callback in the application responsible to handle the limit
condition.</P>
<H2>Reliability</H2>
<P>Reliability requirements, stated in <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 9.3 Reliability]</A> are not explicitly analyzed in this document,
but there is no indication that they cannot be met with the described
architecture. In particular, CORBA itself has been designed having
high reliability and availability as a key requirement.</P>
<H2>Performance</H2>
<P>The current choices for hardware and software platforms and the
architecture for ACS described in the previous sections should ensure
that the required performances are achievable.</P>
<P>Basic performance requirements have been verified with ACS 0.0 on
the Kitt Peak 12m antenna, with the TICS <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD26">[RD26]</A>
and the Protype Pipeline, at the ATF and in the laboratories.</P>
<P>All performance requirements stated in <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 9.4. Performance]</A> are being verified. A set of performance
measuring suites aimed at implementing a realistic system in term of
number and size of objects <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 3.3.1 Size]</A> and of number of interactions has been implemented.
Discussions and results of ACS performance measures are available in
the ACS Wiki page
<A HREF="http://almasw.hq.eso.org/almasw/bin/view/ACS/AcsPerformances">http://almasw.hq.eso.org/almasw/bin/view/ACS/AcsPerformances</A>.
This includes a specific feasibility check of CORBA Audio Video
Streaming service in relation to astronomical data transfer<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">
[RD01 - 10.5.9 Data transfer]</A> and tests of the event and
notification system and logging system performance.</P>
<P>For what concerns generic performance considerations for the ORB
implementations we use, the corresponding web sites (referenced in
the ACS online documentation pages <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD41">[RD41]</A>
) contain a sufficient amount of information.</P>
<P>In the current implementation (ACS 6.0) XML is extensively used
for the Configuration Database, for logging and archiving. The
performances apper to be an issue for the logging system when low
logging levels (trace and debug) are used. Therefore we have now
implemented a new version of the logging system that does not use XML
as transport protocol. We are evaluating the improvement in
perfromance. Performance of XML does not appear to be an issue in the
other cases, but this will have to be verified on a lager scale for
scalability.</P>
<H1>Life cycle aspects</H1>
<P>ACS is being designed and implemented according to what is
specified in <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 11. Life
cycle aspects]</A>.</P>
<P>ACS uses procedures and standards already defined by the Software
Engineering working group. In particular the software development
process is defined by ALMA Common Software Development Plan <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD32">[RD32]</A>.
This document describes also the scope and timetable of the planned
ACS Releases.</P>
<H2>Design requirements</H2>
<P>Different versions of the system can exist in different places at
the same time, with different Configuration Databases, but it must be
possible to synchronize them (for example, development is done on a
control model, with certain test motors, and installation is done on
the telescope, that has different motors) <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 13.1.5 Configuration]</A>.</P>
<P>Code does not always need to be recompiled if new IDL interfaces
are made available or if an IDL interface is changed, for example
adding new methods<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 -
13.1.6. Modularity]</A>. With TAO and JacORB even if an application's
interface changes, both client and server still work if they do not
use the new features. It is possible to have the server exporting one
version of the interface and the client use another version. If an
interface changes, then re-compilation is necessary (as expected)
only for those programs that use the new feature or the methods that
eventually changed signature. This should work also with other ORBs,
since it is due to the existing CORBA IIOP protocol. On the other
hand, this behavior is not explicitly supported and, should the IIOP
protocol ever change, different interfaces might lead to run-time
errors. While this is a potentially useful facility, its use would
need to be standardized and carefully monitored to avoid unpleasant
surprises at runtime. To date, this capability has not been used in
ALMA.&nbsp;</P>
<P>ACS will be integrated and tested with any software specified in
<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 12.3.1 The ACS shall
be integrated and tested]</A>.</P>
<H3>Portability and de-coupling from HW/SW platform</H3>
<P>ACS shall be designed to be portable across Unix, Linux and RTOS
platforms for what concerns its upper level components <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 13.1.7 Portability]</A>.</P>
<P>The higher level of software in particular (co-ordination and user
interface) should be as much as possible portable and de-coupled from
any specific HW and SW platform. This pushes in the direction of the
Java language and of the usage of a portable scripting language like
Python<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD24">[RD24]</A>. Java virtual
machines and Java ORBs are available on any platform and for any web
browser. At present time there are still compatibility issues between
Java Virtual Machines (&quot;compile once, debug everywhere&quot;
syndrome), particularly on a UI with live content. Most interfaces
are not &quot;alive&quot; and do not expose the incompatibilities,
but many ALMA interfaces will have live content. Web browsers are
particularly sensitive to compatibility problems since they usually
incorporate outdated Java Virtual Machines. Experience has shown that
it is best to limit the number of target platforms and that
real-world Java programs should run as independent applications.</P>
<P>Java performance (initially an major reason for concern) is now
adequate for GUIs and for high-level coordination applications with
no real-time performance requirements. Java performance is much worse
when running on a remote X-Server with respect to a local X-Server
and, even more, a Microsoft Windows desktop. Java GUIs should
therefore run preferably locally and not remotely. The ACS
Architecture has been designed for this kind of usage.</P>
<P>It is then suggested to use C++ in performance demanding
applications and Java everywhere else <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 10.3.3 Compiled languages]</A>, with the exception of low level
drivers that can be implemented in plain C language.</P>
<P>Java and C++ interface at the network level through CORBA via IDL
interfaces.</P>
<P>Portability of C++ applications among different versions of UNIX
and UNIX-like RTOSs is improved by adopting the ACE libraries<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD23">[RD23]</A>
and the Posix standard <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 -
10.3.2 High level operating system]</A>, although at the RTOS level
specific real-time features provided by the operating system (VxWorks
for phase 1 <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 10.5.3
RTOS]</A>) can be used<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 -
10.3.1. RTOS]</A>.</P>
<H3>Small, isolated modules for basic services</H3>
<P>Basic services (for example logging and error system) must be
independent from the other packages. Also, access to control system
data must be de-coupled.</P>
<P>CORBA is very well suited for this, since ORBs are available on
any platform and also inside web browsers to provide the basic
communication layer.</P>
