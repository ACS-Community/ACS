<h2>Tasks</h2>
<h3>ACS provides support for tasks. </h3>
<ul>
  <li>A task is a concise program which starts up, performs some processing, and 
    then shuts down. </li>
  <li>A task may or may not require other more advanced ACS services, depending 
    on context. Tasks are specifically intended to address the needs of the Offline 
    team, which needs to be able to implement concise, stand-alone programs which 
    perform some offline data processing or manipulation. </li>
  <li>It is expected that tasks will often be run from the Unix command prompt 
    by typing a simple command (task name) plus some additional information describing 
    the data to be used by the task. </li>
  <li>It is desirable, therefore, that a complete ACS startup scenario not be 
    required in order to run a task; rather, the running of a task should simply 
    involve typing a single command at the unix command prompt. </li>
</ul>
<h3> In order to facilitate the requirement of a simple execution mechanism (i.e. 
  no complete ACS startup required), ACS provides a task mechanism that is able 
  to run either with or without ACS services being up and running. </h3>
<h3>In addition, a special "static container" has been developed which allows 
  the functionality for the ACS container to be linked in directly with the task 
  executable at compile/link time. </h3>
<ul>
  <li>The static container functionality allows the Task mechanism to adhere fully 
    to the ACS component-container model while still requiring no complete startup 
    (e.g. no explicit starting of a C++ container is necessary). </li>
  <li>In the event that ACS services are available, the Task component, using 
    the linked-in static container, will be capable of operating like a full-fledged 
    ACS component. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Tasks will often require parameters (see Parameter section), so two primary 
  types of tasks are provided. </h3>
<h4>A generic Task interface is provided which defines only a single method, <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">run()</font>, 
  which must be implemented by the task developer. </h4>
<h4>A specialization of this generic Task is also provided, ParameterTask, which 
  extends the basic task interface and allows for both a <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">run()</font> 
  and a <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">go()</font> method. </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In ParameterTask, the <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">run()</font> 
  method is implemented by ACS and provides support for defining/parsing parameters 
  passed in via the unix command line, converting the command line parameters 
  to XML in order to construct a ParameterSet object, and then calling the <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">go()</font> 
  method (which will be implemented by the task developer). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Architecture and design</h3>
<p>The Task architecture is very straightforward. </p>
<p>Two IDL interfaces are defined by ACS: Task, the generic task base class, and 
  a specialization of the Task base class which adds command-line parameter handling, 
  ParameterTask. </p>
<p>Both of these types extend from ACSComponent, making them full-fledged Components 
  in the ACS Component-Container model. </p>
