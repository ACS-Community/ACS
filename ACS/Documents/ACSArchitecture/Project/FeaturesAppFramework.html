<h2><a name=HighLevelApplicationFramework></a><a name=DeviceDrivers></a>ACS Application 

  Framework</h2>

<h3>The common software has to provide also an Application Framework allowing 
  an easy implementation of a standard application (a skeleton application) with 
  all essential features<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 5.1.1 Framework]</a>. 
  Inheritance and other mechanisms are used to enhance and extend the basic application 
  according to specific application needs.</h3>

<h3>The application framework enforces common coding solutions and adherence to 

  predefined standards. </h3>

<h3>The application framework shall be implemented as a set of classes that provide:</h3>

<UL>

  <li style='     '>Skeleton for standard application, with standard commands 

    and states </li>

  <li style='     '>Implementation of typical communication Design Patterns </li>

  <li style='     '>Implementation of standard startup/shutdown/configuration 

    procedures</li>

</ul>

<h3>At the very basic level, the Component and Characteristic Component classes 
  and design patterns, together with the services provided by ACS, constitute 
  the core of the Framework.</h3>
<h3>Each physical sub-system is controlled by a Master Component that implements 
  a standard State Machine and standard commands.</h3>
<h3>The Master Component is available in Java because it is assumed that it is 
  an high level coordinating Component. It is used by higher level administration 
  applications to assess and control the global state of a subsystem.</h3>
<h4>The Master Component implements a hierarchical state machine and sub-classes 
  can implement sub-states according to the application needs, keeping a standard 
  top level state machine.</h4>
<h3>A generic State Machine Component is used for the implementation of the Master 
  Component and can be made available for applications that need to design their 
  own Hierarchical State Machines<font color="#0000FF"> (Partially implemented, 
  but not generally available)</font>.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>State Machines are designed in UML</li>
  <li>The Open ArchitectureWare <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD39">[RD39]</a> 
    generator framework is used to generate Java code implementing the state machine</li>
</ul>
<h3>Plenty of examples and coding guidelines define how applications are build 
  and assembled from the basic elements and describe basic protocols for command 
  handling, to ensure for example command concurrence and response time. </h3>
<h3>ALMA subsystems (following these guidelines and what defined in the high level 
  ALMA architecture) have provided an implementation of typical designed patterns 
  and code reviews have allowed cleaning up the implementation. For example Control 
  has implemented base Component classes used for the implementation of all control 
  device Components.</h3>
<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>In order to provide with ACS a complete application 
  framework usable to write completely new applications, the implementation of 
  ALMA subsystems should be distilled to extract higher level framework building 
  blocks. This work is not foreseen for ALMA, since the core architecture of all 
  subsystems is already in place by now.</b></font></h3>
