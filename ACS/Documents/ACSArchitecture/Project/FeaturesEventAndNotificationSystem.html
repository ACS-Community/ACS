<H2><A NAME="CommandHandling"></A>Event and Notification System</H2>
<H3>The Event and Notification System is an implementation of the
Observer Design Pattern. It provides a generic mechanism to
asynchronously pass information between data/event suppliers and
data/event consumers, in a many-to-many relation scheme.</H3>
<H3>With the Event and Notification System (in its basic form):</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the data supplier <I>publishes</I>
	its data <I>pushing</I> it on a <I>channel</I>, completely unaware
	of clients getting access to the data, i.e. the data supplier
	decides how and when data is going to be published 
	</P>
	<LI><P>data consumers <I>subscribe</I> to data sets on the <I>channel</I>
	without establishing any direct communication with the data
	suppliers. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>The Event and Notification System is the basic mechanism for
Indirect Value Retrieval <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 4.1.2 Indirect value retrieval]</A> providing mirroring of data on
computers other than where the data are produced. This makes it
possible to randomly access data without interfering with the control
process <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 3.2.2 Value
retrieval]</A> and without knowing if the data is directly available
on the client's machine or if it is a mirrored copy<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 4.1.4 Transparency]</A>.</H3>
<H3>The CORBA Notification Service provides the infrastructure for
the Event and Notification System implementation:</H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>Figure 3.6: Event and Notification System</I></P>
<H4>An ACS API provides a simplified client and server API to connect
to the Notification Service and to create/connect/disconnect channels
in the Event and Notification System. This does not hinder direct
access to the CORBA Notification Service to access features not
implemented by the API.</H4>
<H4><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Note: The
structured-push-supplier / structured-push-consumer model of the
CORBA Notification Service has been implemented first. Other
Notification Service models can be implemented later on based on
specific application needs (Implementation not foreseen for ALMA)</FONT></FONT>.</H4>
<H4>CORBA TCL (Trader Constraint Language) query language is used to
allow filtering of messages from clients. Filtering is currently only
allowed on simple CORBA types like Floats, Longs, etc.</H4>
<H4>Notification Service servers can be federated to guarantee system
redundancy and to provide higher reliability <I>(Provided by CORBA
but not integrated in ACS yet)</I>. Federated Notification Service
servers allow:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Load balancing. Client access can
	be split among different servers 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Security. Just specific servers, with a reduced set of
	published data (defined using filtering), can be allowed access from
	remote sites. This can be used to allow remote monitoring of ALMA
	from Europe and USA without exposing to the Internet confidential
	data. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>The Notification Service is a process separated both from
publisher and subscriber. It also optimizes data transfer by
implementing caching to reduce network traffic.</H3>
<H3>The current ACS API provides a class for supplying events. An
application instantiates a Supplier or Supplier-derived object and
invokes the publishEvent() method that fills a
CosNotification::StructuredEvent, which is the structure that defines
the data sent on the Notification Channel. The Supplier class takes
care of the whole administration of the Notification Channel
including its creation.</H3>
<H3>SimpleSupplier is a subclass of Supplier designed specifically
for publishing events defined as IDL structures, the normal and most
common situation. It provides the interface used to push IDL structs
onto the notification channel, creates the channel (if it doesnâ€™t
exist), and hides all CORBA from the developer.</H3>
<H3>The current ACS API provides a base class for Consumer as well.
An application implements a subclass of this for each Consumer and
provides an implementation for the push_structured_event() method
that has the purpose of pushing the data in the received
CosNotification::StructuredEvent into appropriate member variables.
The base class takes care of the whole administration of the
connection to the Notification Channel. 
</H3>
<H3>In Java, the Consumer class can directly resolve the event type
using introspection and does not need to be subclassed in most cases.
In C++ instead, a  SimpleConsumer template subclass can be used to
handle events in a generic manner by passing the event type as a
template argument.</H3>
<H3>The Supplier and Consumer classes have a common engine that has
been factorized in the Helper common base class. In particular the
Helper class provides common information such as the &quot;kind&quot;
of the Notification Channel as registered with the CORBA Naming
Service.</H3>
<H3>The CORBA API for the Notify Service does not provide for
retrieving the identifiers of the suppliers and consumers that have
been registered with it. When an application with open subscriptions
terminates without explicitly closing these connections, the
subscriptions remain open within the Notify Service, retaining
resources (threads and memory) uselessly. For ACS 8.0, the interface
to the Notify Service will be changed to delegate the creation of
suppliers and consumers to an ACS entity (typically, Container
Services), so that ACS can clean up connections left open when an
application terminates. 
</H3>
<H3>ACS itself uses the Event and Notification System to provide
basic services like logging and archiving.</H3>
<H3>Comparison between Event and Notification System, Direct Value
Retrieval and Data Retrieval by Event:</H3>
<H4>The 3 data access mechanisms provided by ACS have different
characteristics and are meant to be used in different situations. 
</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the Event and Notification
	System, data subscriber and data publisher are completely
	de-coupled. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Direct Value Retrieval, the
	client needs the reference to the servant object to call get()
	methods that directly return the requested value 
	</P>
	<LI><P>With Value Retrieval by Event, the client establishes a
	callback-based direct communication with the servant that
	asynchronously delivers data to the client in a point-to-point
	communication scheme. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>The Event and Notification System pattern is convenient when:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the client is interested in
	receiving events of a certain type (for instance event logs, monitor
	point values or alarm events) and handling them regardless of their
	source. Since the potential number of sources is very large, it
	becomes very inefficient if the client must establish a connection
	to each potential source. In this case a Notification Channel is
	necessary as the mediator between publishers and subscribers.
	Publishers push data in the channel while the channel efficiently
	multicasts events to all subscribers that are interested in
	receiving them. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>many clients (in particular remote clients) are interested in
	the same data. With a point-to-point communication, the data
	producer would have to deliver data to each of many clients, with a
	potentially heavy impact on servant performances. With the Event and
	Notification System pattern, the servant pushes the data only once
	on the channel that will efficiently multicast the events to the
	interested clients allowing to keep constant the load on the
	servant. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Direct Value Retrieval and Value Retrieval by Event are
convenient when the client needs to be in control of the rate by
which it receives data from the servant (asking directly for the
values, when required, or establishing monitors with a specific data
rate or triggering condition.</H4>
