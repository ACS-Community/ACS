<h2>ACS Installer</h2>

  

<h3>The ACS Installer package provides the possibility to install and configure 
  ACS according to different user's need <b><font color="#0000FF">(Partially implemented)</font></b>.</h3>

<h4>Installation by environment:</h4>

  

<ul>

  <li>Development</li>

  <li> Run time </li>

</ul>

<h4>Installation by application type: </h4>

<ul>

  <li>Full ACS installation </li>

  <li>Real time and control applications </li>

  <li>Data Reduction packages </li>

  <li>High level user interfaces </li>

  <li>Stand alone java application </li>

</ul>

<h4>Installation by format: </h4>

<ul>

  <li>Full binary distribution (all ACS and tools in binary format) </li>

  <li>ACS sources, binary tools distribution (all basic tools are distributed 

    in binary format, but ACS is distributed as sources to be built) </li>

  <li>All sources distribution (ACS and all tools are distributed in source format) 

  </li>

  <li>CVS archive public access (ACS can be downloaded from a CVS archive and 

    build from the code checked out) </li>

</ul>

<h3>Binary installation of ACS can be done by downloading the ACS installer or 

  (depending on the application) directly from the web using Java Web Start technology. 

</h3>

<p>Java Web Start allows to install and upgrade and startup applications using 

  the web in a transparent way and is therefore very convenient for the installation 

  of applications that run on the astronomer's desktop. The tool handles automatic 

  download of dependencies between packages and checks for the availability of 

  new versions of dependecy packages, installing them automatically when needed. 

</p>

<h3>Supported platforms </h3>

<p>ACS is supported on a specified number of platforms, agreed at each release 
  according to the needs of ALMA control and data flow applications. Since not 
  all platforms are needed for all applications, some ACS features can be supported 
  only on a subset of these platforsms. </p>

<p>The Java language has been selected as the most portable language. ACS assumes 

  that applications that need the maximun platform availability will be developed 

  using the Java ACS distribution, that is supported on any platform where a Java 

  Virtual Machine is available. </p>

<p>On the most important platforms ACS will be distributed in binary format. </p>

<p>The ACS source distribution can be used to build ACS on other supported (or 

  also unsupported) platforms. </p>

<h3>Selective installation of tools</h3>

<p> ACS distributes all tools that are not part of the basic operating system 

  installation for all supported platforms. This makes sure that the tools are 

  in the proper versions and are properly configured. </p>

<p>But the ACS installer allow to selectively install only some of these tools, 

  if the user prefers to rely on an own installation. </p>

<h3>Installation verification and reporting tool</h3>

<p> Since ACS is available in many distribution formats to support the needs of 

  users not working 100% with ALMA software, the ACS Installer provides a tool 

  to verify the configuration of the machine where ACS has been installed and 

  to write a report that can be used when requesting support. Without such a tool 

  it would be very difficult to track problems due to a partial installation of 

  the tools or to user-specific operating system and environment settings.</p>
