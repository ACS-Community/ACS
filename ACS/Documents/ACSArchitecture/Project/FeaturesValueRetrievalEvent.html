<H3>The Distributed Object will provide a method to create a monitor object for a Property. A callback will be connected to the event and will be called by the monitor object when an event occurs<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 13.1.4. Events]</A>. The monitor class provides methods to suspend, resume and destroy the monitor itself.</H3><DIR>

<H3>Events can be generated on any change of value<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 4.1.3 Rate]</A>. Other conditions, for example any write, value increase/decrease, value less or greater than setpoint could also be included at a later stage.</H3>
<H3>Timed or periodic events can be generated as follows<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 4.1.3 Rate]</A> <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 4.1.4 Values at given time]</A>:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Periodic, at a specific interval rate </LI>
<LI>Periodic, at a specific interval rate, synchronized with an absolute time</LI></UL>

<H3>All events will be timestamped</H3>
<H3>Events generated by timers allow to retrieve time stamped data at a specific array time <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 4.1.5 Values at given time]</A></H3>
<H3>Properties also publish their value on the Archiving Notification Channel (see the corresponding section), a publisher/subscriber model. This can be used as another sort of data retrieval by event not based on callbacks.</H3>
<H3>A particular case is a Distributed Object State Machine. A State Machine class is a Distributed Object and the current state is represented by a State Property. This State Property can fire events whenever the state changes to allow external objects to monitor it.</H3>
<H3>Hardware monitor points, like monitor points on the CAN bus do not support any notification on change. To support events of monitor points they need to be polled.</H3>
<H3>For performance optimization, the final implementation will not leave to the single Distributed Object Properties the responsibility of managing timers, but a local centralized manager will take care of that, transparently to client applications. More details will be given in the ACS design. </H3>
