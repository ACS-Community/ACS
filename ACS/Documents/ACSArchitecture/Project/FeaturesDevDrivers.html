<H3>Device drivers for all standard boards (motor control, analog, digital, serial…) 
  and network protocols (serial communication, CAN bus<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
  - 10.5.12 Field-bus]</A>,…) are provided as part of the ACS delivery, if they 
  are not already part of the operating system, although development of device 
  drivers is not direct responsibility of ACS. They will be typically provided 
  as part of M&amp;C software development and integrated into the ACS releases 
  is considered necessary<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 12.2.1 
  Hardware Interfaces]</A>. This integration must be taken into account both in 
  the design of ACS and of Device Drivers.</H3>

<H3>A communication library working over CAN is already part of the M&amp;C work<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD12">[RD12]</A> 
  and has been harmonized with these concepts. For every CAN device there must 
  be one or more Objects on the CAN bus master CPU, which are the abstract Characteristic 
  Components corresponding to the physical CAN device. </H3>

<H3>Low level access to the CAN bus nodes iscompletely hidden to the general user 
  (engineering applications can directly access the CAN nodes).</H3>
