<H2>Bulk Data</H2>
<P>ACS provides support for the transport of bulk data <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 7.1. Bulk data transfer]</A>, to be used for science data. 
</P>
<H3>The following use cases are supported:</H3>
<H4>Push streaming. Connection initiated by the supplier.</H4>
<P>A data supplier produces a continuous stream of data for a
specific bulk data consumerComponent. Typical example is the
Correlator sending continuous streams of data to the Archive. 
</P>
<P>The basic operations are as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supplier gets access to the
	consumer Component 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Opens a connection. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Data is sent by the supplier to
	the consumer until 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The supplier closes the connection 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Push discrete bulk data. Connection initiated by the supplier</H4>
<P>A data supplier produces bulks of data as separate, non continuous
streaming, entities. Typical example is a data processing Component
sending images to another Component for further processing.
Everything works like in the previous case, but for the fact that the
communication protocol must be able to identify separate bulks of
data, like a single image.</P>
<H4>Pull data from stream. Connection initiated by consumer.</H4>
<P>An application needs streaming data published by a Stream Provider
Component. There can be multiple clients. Typical example is a GUI
connecting to a CCD camera. Multiple GUIs can display the image from
the same Camera.</P>
<P>The basic operations are a follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supplier Component is
	available for publishing data 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The client opens a connection with
	the supplier 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supplier sends data to the
	client(s) until 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The client closes the connection 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Pull discrete bulk data. Connection initiated by the consumer.</H4>
<P>An application needs to retrieve discrete bulks of data as
separate, non continuous streaming, entities. Typical example is
retrieval of images from the archive. Everything works like in the
previous case, but for the fact that the communication protocol must
be able to identify separate bulks of data, like a single image. 
</P>
<H3>Performance considerations</H3>
<P>It shall be possible to handle the actual transfer of data with
communication protocols more efficient than CORBA IIOP, in particular
for high volume streams.</P>
<P>When there are multiple clients for the data published we have
implemented a service architecture in which the data supplier sends
the data to just one Distributor which, in turn, sends them to a
number of connecting clients. This decouples the load due to the
increasing number of clients from the supplier.</P>
<P>Precise performance requirements have been collected and verified
with the ACS Bulk Data system implementation based on the CORBA Audio
Video streaming service. Tests have demonstrated that the ACS
implementation can deliver 700 â€“ 800 Mbit/s to three consumers
simultaneously.</P>
<H3>Architecture and design</H3>
<H4>Bulk data transfer can be implemented in CORBA using three
techniques:</H4>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Iterators on normal IDL methods 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Notification Channel 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Audio Video Streaming Service 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>The first two options are based on the IIOP transport protocol and
therefore suffer from performance limitations, although tests
available in the literature show that properly designed buffering
limits these problems. Option 1 is better suited for discrete bulk
data while option 2 is better suited for streaming.</P>
<P>Option 3 is based on the Audio Video Streaming Service <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD42">[RD42]</A>
defined by CORBA. This specification aims at the streaming and
transfer of large amounts of data and satisfies the requirements
expressed in <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 7.1.1
Image pipeline]</A>. The handshaking protocol is defined using CORBA
IDL Media Control interfaces, but the actual data transfer goes out
of band and does not use (but could use) CORBA to transport data. TAO
provides an implementation and provides transport over TCP and UDP
with excellent performance<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD43">[RD43]</A>.</P>
<H4>The CORBA Audio Video Streaming Service supports all the use
cases described above.</H4>
<H5>There are the following basic concepts:</H5>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stream<BR>A stream represents
	continuous media transfer between two or more entities. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flow<BR>A stream can be composed
	of many flows.<BR>For example a video camera stream has a video and
	an audio flow.<BR>As an example strictly related to ALMA, the
	Correlator will have one stream to send bulk data to the Archive,
	but this would be split in up to 8 flows with at least 2 always
	present: 1 per subarray, 1 for spectral data and 1 for channel
	average.<BR>Each flow can have independent quality of service
	parameters and each flow can have an independent direction (upload
	or download). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Frames<BR>A frame is a unit of data sent over a flow. <BR>A
	frame of a video is a typical example.<BR>A set of data published by
	the Correlator can be mapped to a frame as well.<BR>The basic A/V
	service does not have the concept of frame. The SFP (Simple Flow
	Protocol), on top of the physical transport protocol, introduces the
	concept of frame in the A/V service and protocol messages to
	identify and number the frames are added to the actual data. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H5>Data published on a Flow is received via a callback implemented
by the receiving Component. 
</H5>
<H5>The push use cases are implemented using an upload flow. The pull
use cases are implemented using a download flow.</H5>
<H5>The Bulk Data Components implement the Media Control interfaces
(and extend them as needed). 
</H5>
<H5>Streaming use cases are implemented using the start control
commands on the Component to notify that the stream has started and
not sending the stop command until the stream needs to be closed.
Structuring of the data sent in the stream or the SFP protocol are
used for synchronization and framing of the message.</H5>
<H5>Discrete use cases are implemented using the start and stop
stream commands to identify each discrete piece of bulk data. These
will be wrapped in convenience interfaces. In this way it is not
necessary to inspect the incoming data to identify the frame boundary
and the end of data.</H5>
<H4>Limitations of the CORBA Audio Video Streaming Service</H4>
<P>There is no implementation of CORBA A/V service for Java or
Python. The producers and consumers of the bulk data stream
(Correlator, Control, TelCal, Pipeline and Archive) all use C++
implementations of the bulk data senders and receivers as ACS
components. Java and Python applications can access these components
via the normal ACS/CORBA interfaces. There is therefore no
requirement for implementation of CORBA A/V in languages other than
C++. For example, image data processing typically takes place between
C++ Components without requiring high performance image transfer to
Java or Python Components.
