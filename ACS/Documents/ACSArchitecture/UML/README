This directory contains the UML Model for ACS in Magic Draw.


In order to be able to work with the Model from Linux, 
the environment variable

        MAGIC_DRAW_HOME

must be set to the path of the Magic Draw tool.

For example:

        /home/almamgr/MagicDraw_UML/


The perl script mdExtractImages executes Magic Draw in batch more
to extract the images.

The mdExtractHtml is used to generate the HTML view of the model.

These scripts have been tested with MagicDraw 16.0.
The script mdExtractHtml does NOT work with MagidDraw 15.1
