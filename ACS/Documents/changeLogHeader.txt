# This file contains the change log of
# the CVS ACS/Documents archive
# used to generate automatically the
# documentation in the ACS web pages.
#
# From the list of changes described here
# you should be able to easily find out what documents
# have been updated since you looked the last time
# to the ACS documentation.
#
# We know that preducing a list of changes directly 
# for the ACS documentation page would be nicer
# for you.
# But with the web technoology we are currently using
# this is for us the simplest and cheapest way to
# provide you with "almost" the same information.
