		<H1>Test summary: </H1>
		For this test, we sent CHANGE_NUMBER_OF_LOGS logs per component, with a delay of CHANGE_DELAY milliseconds between each log.<br> 
		The acs services (loggingService, acsLogSvc, and Notify_Service processes included)
		were run on the the host: CHANGE_ACSHOST_NAME. <br>
		We used CHANGE_NUMBER_OF_SUPPLIERS component(s) each running in a separate container on host: CHANGE_PUBLISHER_HOST_NAME.<br>
		The components were implemented in: CHANGE_PUBLISHER_LANGUAGE.	<br>
		<font color=CHANGE_RESULT_FONT_COLOR>CHANGE_RESULT:</font> we were expected to receive a total of: CHANGE_TOTAL_EXPECTED messages, 
			and we received: CHANGE_TOTAL_RECEIVED.
