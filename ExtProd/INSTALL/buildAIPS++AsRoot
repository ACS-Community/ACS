#   The build will try to remove the same rpms that it 
#   is going to install, before beginning the actual installation. 
#
#   The installation shall be done as root. The rpms get installed 
#   under /usr. ~650MB of space are needed. 
#
#   AIPS++ installation can be done on RH9 only

#
# Install AIPS++. We presume that no previous AIPS++ installation
# are present on the machine. For the moment (ACS 3.1) root priviledges 
# are needed. The installation will be done under /usr.
#
#  See http://aips2.nrao.edu/daily/docs/reference/install.html for information.
