This directory contains the UML Model for ACS in Magic Draw.

In order to be able to work with the Model from Linux, 
the environment variable

        MAGIC_DRAW_HOME

must be set to the path of the Magic Drawe tool.
For example:

        /home/almamgr/MagicDraw_UML/

The perl script mdExtractImages executes Magic Draw in batch more
to extract the images.

Another script will be soon added to generate the HTML view of the model.
