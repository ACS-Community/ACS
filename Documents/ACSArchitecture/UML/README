This directory contains the UML Model for ACS in Raitonal Rose.

In order to be able to work with the Model, the Rose virtual path map variable

        $ALMA_ACS_ROOT

must be set to the absolute path or this directory

The script extractDiagrams.sh is a wrapper around the python script
extractDiagrams.py.
Their purpose is to copy the diagrams produced by the Rose Web
Publisher in a different directory with a file name derived from the
original diagram name.
The file names produced by the Web Publisher are random names that
bare no relation with the original diagram name, making it impossible
to use them outside the Web Publisher itself.
