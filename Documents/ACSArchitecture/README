This directory contains all files needed to build the ACS Architecture
document.
All previous versions have been imported in CVS on 2003-12-29 by
G.Chiozzi.

ATTENTION:
  - This structure is still being ported from:
        Rational Rose   to   Magic Draw
        Microsoft Word  to   Open Office
    and a couple of things still do not work.
    Check inside the Makefile for details.

Document main files:
-------------------

ACSArchitecture.doc
   This is the main document and the one to be actually edited
   It contains links to all sub components (mainly HTML files)
  

UML Directory:
-------------
This directory contains the UML model for ACS.
It is important after check out and after changes to 
export the model as html.

Project Directory:
-----------------
This directory contains all HTML files that
are used to compose the Document.doc document and that
make the HTML version of this Architecture document
(plus the contents of the Help directory).
The sub-directory Project/Images contains all pictures
used inside the HTML files.
Most of the files in this directory are diagrams
extracted from the Magic Draw UML model.
Just a few diagrams come from other sources.
After a checkout from CVS make sure that the UML diagrams are
extracted from the model

Makefile:
--------
The Makefile is used to generate in batch from the Magic Draw
the HTML export and all diagrams used in the HTML files.
