<h2><a name=HighLevelApplicationFramework></a><a name=DeviceDrivers></a>ACS Application 
  Framework</h2>
<h3>The common software has to provide also an application framework that allows 
  an easy implementation of a standard application (a skeleton application) with 
  all essential features<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 5.1.1 Framework]</a>. 
  Inheritance and other mechanisms are used to enhance and extend the basic application 
  according to specific application needs.</h3>
<h3>The application framework enforces common coding solutions and adherence to 
  predefined standards. </h3>
<h3>The application framework will be implemented as a set of classes that provide:</h3>
<ul type=disc>
  <li style='     '>Skeleton for standard application, with standard commands 
    and states </li>
  <li style='     '>Implementation of typical communication Design Patterns </li>
  <li style='     '>Implementation of standard startup/shutdown/configuration 
    procedures</li>
</ul>
<h3>This implementation follows defined protocols for command handling, to guarantee 
  for example command concurrence and response time. A way to make sure that these 
  requirements for a server are satisfied is to provide an extensible framework 
  that implements all these design patterns. </h3>
<h3>At the higher level the same concepts can be applied to coordination applications 
  and most of these same patterns go well over the boundaries of the control system.</h3>
<h3>The application framework will support the development of C++, Java and Python 
  applications and clients</h3>
<h3>For example, each physical sub-system is controlled by a Master Component 
  that implements a standard State Machine and standard commands.</h3>
<h3>The Master Component is available in Java because it is assumed that it is 
  an high level coordinating Component. It will be used by higher level administration 
  applications to assess and control the global state of a subsystem.</h3>
<h4>The Master Component implements a hierarchical state machine and sub-classes 
  can implement sub-states according to the application needs, keeping a stantard 
  top level state machine.</h4>
<h3>A State Machine Component will be made available for applications that need 
  to design their own Hierarchival State Machines (Not implemented yet).</h3>
<ul>
  <li>State Machines will be designed in UML</li>
  <li>The Open ArchitectureWare <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD39">[RD39]</a> 
    generator framework will generate Java, C++ and/or Python code implementing 
    the state machine</li>
</ul>
