<h2><a name=AlarmSystem>Alarm System</a></h2>



<p>The Alarm System provides a mechanism for notifying asynchronously operators 



  and registered applications of the occurrence of important anomalous conditions 



  that can disrupt the observation or be potentially dangerous for the <span



class=GramE>system</span><a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.4.1 



  Definition]</a>.</p>



<h3>The design and implementation of the ACS Alarm System are based on the Laser 
  system developed by CERN for the LHC accelerator <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD19">[RD19<span class=GramE>]</span></a> 
  and take into account the OVRO hierarchical alarm system <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD22">[RD22<span class=GramE>]</span></a><a



href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.4.5. <span class=GramE>Hierarchy]</span></a><span



class=GramE>. For more details on the Laser system and for a very good Alarm System 
  Requirements Document see <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD19">[RD19<span class=GramE>]</span></a>.</span></h3>

<h3>An Alarm System API implemented in C++, Java and Python allows applications 

  to publish Alarms.</h3>

<h3>Properties are able to trigger alarms. The simple alarm is triggered when 
  the value of the property exceeds or falls below the alarm limits defined for 
  the property. </h3>
<h3><span class=SpellE><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF">Hysteresis</font></span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#0000FF"> 
  could be implemented for the alarm limits <b>(<i>Implementation not foreseen 
  for ALMA</i>)</b>.</font></h3>



<h3>Alarms are events published on an Alarm Notification Channel. Notification 

  is done when the alarm is set and when it is cleared.</h3>



<h3>Whenever an alarm is set or cleared, the event is logged in the Logging System 



  <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.4.6. <span class=GramE>Alarm 



  logging]</span></a><span class=GramE>.</span></h3>



<h3>Alarm events are characterized by the following information:</h3>



<UL>



  <li style='     '>An enumerated state property with the values: GOOD, WARNING, 



    BAD </li>



  <li style='     '>A timestamp property describing when the alarm status changed 



  </li>



  <li style='     '>A set of description characteristics <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 



    - 6.4.7. Configuration]</a>, including (on top of the standard ones like description, 



    URL for extended documentation...) a severity <a



     href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.4.3. Severity]</a> </li>



</ul>



<h3>An Alarm Server application keeps track of all active alarms.</h3>



<h3>Hierarchical alarms can be constructed by the Alarm Server that behaves as 
  client on top of the available alarm system and re-publish <span class=SpellE>hierarchical</span> 
  alarms. </h3>



<h3>The Alarm Server is also responsible to maintain State Alarms. These are alarms 
  that maintain an internal state. In this case the alarm will be incarnated by 
  an Alarm Object whose life cycle is controlled by the Alarm Server. They will 
  have the following additional properties:</h3>



<UL>



  <li style='     '>An enumerated occurrence property (FIRST OCCURRENCE, MULTIPLE 



    OCCURRENCE....<span class=GramE>)</span><a



     href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.4.4. State]</a> </li>



  <li style='     '>A property holding the status of user acknowledge, when required. 
    Some alarms just disappear when the alarm condition is cleared, but others 
    require an explicit acknowledgment from the operator<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
    - 6.4.2 Behavior]</a></li>



</ul>



<h3>It is possible to define actions that have to be started on the occurrence 

  of a given alarm condition <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.4.8. 

  <span class=GramE>Binding]</span></a><span class=GramE>.</span> Applications 

  can use normal Notification Channel techniques to request a notification to 

  be sent for the occurrence of specific alarms.</h3>



<h3>An <span class=SpellE>alarmDisplay</span> GUI provides an operator user interface 
  to the alarms. Using this application the operator can browse through the currently 
  active alarms, request for detailed information and help about a specific alarm, 
  acknowledge alarms when this is required.</h3>
<h3>The Alarm System supports the definition of reduction rules.</h3>
