<h2> <a NAME="GraphicalUserInterfaceTools"></a>User Interface Libraries and Tools</h2>

<h3> The Java language<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD06">[RD06]</a> is the 

  current choice for GUI development, in particular coupled with the SWING graphical 

  library</h3>

<h4> A rich set of widgets is part of the standard package.</h4>

<h4> Java is highly platform independent <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 

  - 12.1.1 Portability]</a>. GUIs are platform independent and can be developed 

  on any system and run on any other system<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 

  - 12.1.2 Extended Portability]</a>.</h4>

<h4> Java Applets can run inside Web Browsers for the deployment of low complexity 

  GUIs on remote sites <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 12.1.2 Extended 

  Portability]</a>.</h4>

<h4> Both Java and Web Browsers have good CORBA support. JacORB<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD34"> 

  [RD34]</a> is the ORB currently used to provide CORBA support in Java.</h4>

<h3> ACS provides in addition a standard set of tools for the development of user 
  interfaces<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 12.1.3 Tools]</a>. 
  This includes:</h3>

<h4> Integrated Development Environment. A COTS Java Integrated Development Environment, 

  including a GUI builder, has to be selected. The current choice is Eclipse<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD35">[RD35]</a>, 

  that is a multi-platform, free project, with the Eclipse Visual Editor project 

  plugin. There is no point in developing a proprietary tool.</h4>

<h4> Standard set of widgets for the implementation of applications with common 
  look and feel. The adoption of the Characteristic Component concepts allows 
  reuse of many Java Beans developed in the particle accelerator community specifically 
  for the implementation of control systems. In particular the ABeans developed 
  for ANKA<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD04">[RD04]</a> provide a set of widgets 
  for ACS aware of of the Characteristic Component design pattern. ABeans are 
  integrated in Eclipse <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD35">[RD35]</a> as a 
  plugin that makes use of the Eclipse Visual Editor. Performance problems with 
  the Abeans implementation limit their usage to small GUI applications, with 
  a limited number of widgets.</h4>

<h4> Standard Java class libraries for the integration with all services provided 

  by the ACS.</h4>

<h3>The ALMA Executive subsystem has designed a standard GUI user interface architecture 
  that allows to implement GUI plugins for the main Executive GUI.</h3>
<h3>Plotting will be an important element in GUIs (see also <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD45">[RD45 
  - EVLA Engineering Software Requirements, 4 Plotting]</a><a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD46">[RD46 
  - EVLA Array Operations Software Requirments, 3.5 Plotting]</a>. ACS integrates 
  an advanced Java GUI class library <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD45">[RD47 
  - JFreeChart]</a>. Plotting widgets are integrated with ABeans for the development 
  of applications and are available with all tools capable of monitoring values, 
  like Object Explorer.</h3>

<h3> These Java and Python GUI tools allow developers and end-users to design 

  and create their own display <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD46">[RD46 - 

  EVLA Array Operations Software Requirments, 2.8 Display Builder]</a>.</h3>

<h3>All GUIs for generic ACS applications, (Object Explorer, logMonitor...) will 
  be developed using ACS standard GUI libraries <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
  - 12.1.5 ACS GUIs]</a>. Tools, prototype and engineering GUIs can be implemented 
  in Python.</h3>
<h3>GUIs shall not implement any control logic<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
  - 12.1.4 Modularity]</a>. They should be dummy applications that simply send 
  commands to Components and access Properties of Characteristic Components for 
  display and update. Any action performed through a GUI shall also be available 
  using command line commands, script or simple programs and no GUI shall be strictly 
  required to drive the system. </h3>

<h3> Online documentation and help</h3>

<h4>Integration with the Web through the usage of an HTML/XML Browser provides 

  access to online documentation <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD45">[RD45 

  - EVLA Engineering Software Requirements, 5 Documentation and Help]</a><a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD46">[RD46 

  - EVLA Array Operations Software Requirments, 1.4 Online Help]</a>.</h4>

<h4>Java help<br>

  Online help systems, for example for graphical user interfaces, shall use he 

  the JavaHelp extension (http://java.sun.com/products/javahelp/index.jsp): help 

  pages are written in html and they are rendered inside the application by the 

  help browser that it pard of the Java Development Kit (jhall-2.0_02.jar). This 

  allows to deploy help pages locally or throught the web and, the other way around, 

  to reference and access web pages from the application's help browser. </h4>

<blockquote> 

  <ul>

    <ul>

      <li>help location: an application passes the html resources to the help 

        browser when it creates it. A webserver would be used if no help resources 

        exists locally</li>

      <li> context sensitive help: GUI widgets providing context help shall be 

        named using setName(&quot;abc&quot;) to allow identifying the proper help 

        topic for them dynamically<br>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </ul>

</blockquote>

<h4>Printed help and documentation<br>

  If the same document shall provide both online help and printed documentation, 

  it is often convenient to write it in a higher level, more printing friendly, 

  format than plain html, as long as a good conversion to PDF for printing and 

  HTML for online usage are available and can be made automatic through Makefile. 

</h4>

<h4>A good and proven solution is Latex (currently used to produce OT documentation):</h4>

<h4>OT help pages are written in latex. Before each OT user test, Alan generates 
  a pdf file from them which is good to download and printout.</h4>

<ul>

  <ul>

    <li>all help pages are kept together with the source code in the UserDoc directory</li>

    <li>the makefile take care of processing them to produce documentation: 

      <ul>

        <li>it runs latex2html</li>

        <li> it converts the postscript pictures to jpg</li>

        <li> it creates the meta-information needed for the Java Help Library 

          (TOC, etc.) dynamically<br>

          the rest is just the same as in the commandcenter</li>

        <li> packs them together in a jar file xxxHelp.jar</li>

      </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<h4>The Java Web Start<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD36">[RD40]</a> technology 
  is used to deploy and update GUIs and more in general Java applications on remote 
  sites without requiring installation of specific and heavy software packages. 
  Using this technology, GUIs do not run inside the Web Browser but as stand-alone 
  applications.</h4>
<h4> LabView<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD13">[RD13]</a> can be integrated 

  with ACS and be used, for example, as a platform to develop engineering GUIs. 

  It is possible to implement ACS functions in LabView applications via Code Interface 

  Nodes (CIN). In this way LabVIEW GUIs can control and interact with standard 

  ACS Components.</h4>
