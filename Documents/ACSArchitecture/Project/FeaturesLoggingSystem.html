<h2><a name=LoggingSystem>Logging System</a></h2>

<p>Logging is a general mechanism used to store any kind of status and diagnostic 

  information in an archive, so that it is possible to retrieve and analyze it 

  at a later time. </p>

<h3>ACS Logging System is based on CORBA Telecom Log <span class=GramE>Service</span><a



href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD14">[RD14]</a> and on the ACS Event

and Notification System architecture</h3>

<h3>Applications can log information at run time according to specific formats 

  in order to <span class=GramE>record</span><a



href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.2.1 Logging]</a>: </h3>

  <ul type=circle>

    <li>The execution of actions </li>

    <li>The status of the system </li>

    <li>Anomalous conditions</li>

  </ul>

<h3>Logging includes for example: </h3>

 <ul type=circle>

    <li>Device commands - reception and execution of commands from devices <a



      href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 14.1.1 Logging of commands]</a> 

    </li>

    <li>Debugging - Optional debugging messages, like notification of entering/leaving 

      specific code sections. </li>

    <li>Unrecoverable programmatic errors </li>

    <li>Alarms - change of status in alarm points </li>

    <li>Miscellaneous log messages. Applications can log events regarded as important 

      to archive, for example receivers changing frequency, antennas set to new 

      targets etc.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>Each log consists of an XML string with <span class=GramE>timestamp</span><a



href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.2.1 Logging]</a>, information on 

  the object sending the log and its location in the system, a formatted log message. 

   Context specific information is entered as (name, value) pairs. The XML format 

  is defined in the Log Markup Language (<span class=SpellE>logMl</span>) XML 

  Schema.</h3>

<h3>The logging system is centralized so that eventually the logs are archived 

  in a central log.</h3>

<h3>Log clients can subscribe to the Log Notification Channel. The permanent Log Archive 

  <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.2.2 Persistency]</a> (an RDBMS) 

  is essentially such a client and its implementation is left to the application.</h3>

<h3>Applications log data using the API provided by ACS. This API provides methods 

  for logging information of the different kinds specified above. A C++, Java 

  and Python APIs are provided. The APIs are based on the standard logging facilities 

  provided by the implementation language, <span class=SpellE>when</span> available:</h3>

<ul type=disc>

  <li>the C++ API is based on the ACE Log</li>

  <li>the Java API is based on the J2SE Java Logging</li>

  <li>the Python API uses a generic ACS CORBA Logging service</li>

</ul>

<h3>Logs can be cached locally on the machine where they are generated by a logging 

  proxy and transmitted to the central log on demand or when the local buffer 

  reaches a predefined size. High priority logs are not cached but are transmitted 

  to the central log immediately. The main purpose of caching is to reduce network 

  traffic.</h3>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Figure 3.9: Logging System</i></p>

<h3>In particular the C++ API is optimized for performance and reduced network 

  traffic and implements caching.</h3>

<h3>The log API should allow for filtering, so that log entries with low priority 

  do not get logged. The filter can for example be set to log or not log debug 

  messages. The filter level is determined at run time and can be set through 

  a command or through external configuration files. (Not possible yet to dynamically 

  change logging levels. Level defined at startup).</h3>

<h3>The API for error logging must be done such as to prevent message flooding. 

  It shall handle repeated error messages - possibly a mechanism to not report 

  the same error more than once, unless reset. (Not implemented yet).</h3>

<h3>In addition, a CORBA ACS Logging Service is available for any CORBA application 

  to log even if no specific API is available. The IDL interface of the CORBA 

  ACS Logging Service provides, on top of the standard CORBA Telecom Logging Service, 

  methods for each type of log defined in ACS. Values for the relevant log fields 

  are passed as parameters and the Service takes the responsibility of formatting 

  them in appropriate XML strings and sending them to the CORBA Telecom Logging.</h3>

<h3>A user interface (log monitor) allows to monitor the logs while they are produced, 
  in quasi-real-time, and to browse the historical database offline. It provides 
  filtering, sorting capabilities <a



href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.2.3 Filtering]</a>. It provides 
  searching capabilities. It is useful to filter logs by inclusion and exclusion 
  and logical combinations based on any logging field, like: </h3>

<ul type=disc>

    <li>time </li>

    <li>process that generated the log </li>

    <li>name of item logged </li>

    <li>all things from a device node down to the leaves </li>

    <li>type of item logged</li>

</ul>

<h3>The log monitor is implemented as a Java application and it will use standard 

  beans based on JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for accessing the long term 

  relational database and standard XML parsers to access the short term logs. 

  (Not implemented yet).</h3>

<h3>If the Logging System crashes or cannot keep up with log requests, subsystem 

  performance should not be affected but the log system should record that logs 

  have been lost. The log system will run with lower priority than normal application 

  processes, in particular on the control system.</h3>

<h3>The logging system is NOT meant to allow &quot;re-run&quot; observing sequences 

  from log messages, but to allow analyzing a posteriori the exact behavior of 

  the system. Since the system will never be the same twice, it will never be 

  possible to execute twice exactly the same set of actions. The task of making 

  observing sequences reproducible must be assigned to the higher level observation 

  scheduler and the logging system has to be used to understand what eventually 

  did not go as planned in the observing sequence and to fix the identified problems.</h3>

<h3>Debugging logs are always present in code. Multi-level output of debugging 

  logs can be switched on/off by setting the priority for log filtering. No compile 

  time debugging flags are necessary, except when strict real time concerns apply.</h3>
