  calculation routines and data reduction (like SLA, TPOINT, AIPS++)<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01

  package. </P>

  available with each ACS installation package or only for specific ALMA internal 
  distributions, where the library is actually used according to the agreed license.</P>
