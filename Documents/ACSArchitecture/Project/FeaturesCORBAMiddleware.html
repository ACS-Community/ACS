  ACS distribution contains the binary version of the ORBs and Services and allows 
  rebuilding the binaries from sources. Whenever possible the original distribution 
  from the vendor, in the right versions, is provided; in some case specific ACS 
  patches are distributed together with the original distribution.</P>
