<H3><B>Entity data</B>, i.e. complex data structures of moderate
volume, are often represented as XML in the ALMA system. According to
the ALMA Technical Architecture described in the <I>ALMA Software
Architecture</I><A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD33">[RD33]</A>,
XML is used to:</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">define the content and structure
	of the entity objects that are passed between subsystems 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">automatically generate the classes
	needed to access the data contained in these entity objects,
	optionally validating changes to a data value by an explicit call to
	validate() or implicit validation during (un-)marshalling; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">serialize these objects for
	network transmission; 
	</P>
	<LI><P>facilitate the storage of these. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>The primary language used to define data entities in ALMA is UML,
c.f. <I>ALMA Software Architecture</I><A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD33">[RD33]</A>.
</H3>
<H4>UML is used as a higher-level layer, from which the previously
hand-crafted XML Schemas are now automatically generated. The data
transport format will remain XML though, and the XML schemas are
still visible to developers when defining database queries. 
</H4>
<H4>Support for data modeling, code generation, and data handling in
ALMA is split between ACS and the HLA subsystem: 
</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ACS provides the generator
	framework, 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">HLA maintains the UML model and
	defines what code gets generated from it 
	</P>
	<LI><P>ACS provides generic mechanisms to generate Java binding
	classes from XML schema, and to present instances of these classes
	to application software, thus removing the need to explicitly deal
	with XML data. See below on details. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>We assume that access to entity data will be primarily of concern
to Java high level applications, therefore ACS priority is to provide
optimal support for Java.</H4>
<H3>Entity data structures are conceptually defined as UML classes.
Technically they are defined by means of XML Schemas which are
derived automatically from UML.</H3>
<H3>Programming language classes (for example Java, C++ and Python)
to wrap and facilitate access to entity structures could be generated
automatically from the XML Schema (XML binding to language-specific
classes). The Castor<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD36">[RD36]</A>
open source framework is currently used for Java binding. Castor XML
binding provides also validation code for the accessors, based on the
XML Schema. A similar, but not as complete, open-source binding
framework for Python, generateDS, will be delivered with ACS 8.0. No
such facility is currently foreseen (or required) for C++.</H3>
<H3>For data structures defined in UML, code generators are based on
the <B>Open ArchitectureWare</B> Project <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD39">[RD39]</A>
generator framework. We generate from the XMI UML representation:</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">XML Schema as described in the
	previous paragraphs 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Binding classes for Java (based on
	Castor), C++ and Python (custom made) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">IDL interface definition files 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">HTML documentation 
	</P>
	<LI><P>any other format needed, by implementing custom generators 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>Entity data is passed among Components as XML strings<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 10.5.10 XML]</A>. Each Component operation that sends/receives an
entity data structure, will have an IDL interface where the
corresponding parameter is represented as a CORBA string. This is a
commonly accepted way of implementing serialization. <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 3.3.2. Serialization]</A> and migration<A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 3.3.3. Migration]</A> of objects without using CORBA Object by
Value (ObV). As already mentioned in the Error System section, ObV is
not implemented by most ORBs, is still immature and its usage is
problematic.</H3>
<H3>ACS Java Container makes (un)-marshalling transparent to the
user, interposing a proxy class between the IDL stub/skeleton and the
implementation:</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given the IDL description of a
	Component, a code generator is used to generate a
	&lt;Component&gt;Interface class. In this class, every EntityDataXML
	parameter has been replaced by the corresponding EntityData binding
	class. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Java introspection is used to
	dynamically generate a &lt;Component&gt;DynamicProxy and a
	&lt;Component&gt;DynamicSkeleton class. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&lt;Component&gt;DynamicProxy is
	used by clients and converts client side calls from the
	EntityDataXML to the EntityData (un)-marshalled calls and forwards
	the messages to the &lt;Component&gt;Stub class generated by the IDL
	compiler. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&lt;Component&gt;DynamicSkeleton
	is a delegation class that converts servant side calls from the
	EntityDataXML to the EntityData (un)-marshalled calls and forwards
	the message to the user defined &lt;Componet&gt;Impl real
	implementation class. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Clients and the servant implementation of the component will
	therefore only see the interface of the &lt;Component&gt;Interface
	class, that does not use XML strings but binding classes. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><A NAME="_x0000_i1025"></A><IMG SRC="Images/Serialization_Plugs__XML_serialization.png" WIDTH="562" HEIGHT="426"  NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER=0><BR><I>Figure

serialization</I> 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>The usage of the proxy approach allows the container to:</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Shortcut local calls (i.e. calls inside the same Container), so that
	no XML serialization is needed and the binding class is passed
	directly (<I>not implemented yet</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">)</SPAN>.
		</P>
	<LI><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intercept calls to
	Components, allowing the implementation of the Tight Container
	pattern (see ACS Container section). 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>For C++ and Python it is not foreseen to implement transparent
(un-)marshalling like in Java. This choice is based on the assumption
that Java clients and Components will be the most adequate whenever
serialization is needed. If C++ and Python support will be necessary,
they will be implemented at a later stage based on the code
generation engine <B>(Not implemented yet)</B>.</H3>
<H3>In case no XML binding generator is available (for example for
clients written in a language different from Java, C++ or Python), we
anyway expect that it will be acceptable to work directly on the XML
strings with an XML parser.</H3>
