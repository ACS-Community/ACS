<h2><a name="CommandHandling">Event and Notification System</a></h2>
<h3>The Event and Notification System is an implementation of the
Observer Design Pattern. It provides a generic mechanism to
asynchronously pass information between data/event suppliers and
data/event consumers, in a many-to-many relation scheme.</h3>
<h3>With the Event and Notification System (in its basic form):</h3>
<ul type="disc">
  <li style="">the data supplier <i>publishes</i> its data <i>pushing</i>
it on a <i>channel</i>, completely unaware of clients getting access
to the data, i.e. the data supplier decides how and when data is going
to be published </li>
  <li style="">data consumers <i>subscribe</i> to data sets on the <i>channel</i>
without establishing any direct communication with the data suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Event and Notification System is the basic mechanism for
Indirect Value Retrieval <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 4.1.2 Indirect value retrieval]</a> providing mirroring of data on
computers other than where the data are produced. This makes it
possible to randomly access data without interfering with the control
process <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 3.2.2 Value
retrieval]</a> and without knowing if the data is directly available on
the client's machine or if it is a mirrored copy<a
 href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 4.1.4 Transparency]</a>.</h3>
<h3>The CORBA Notification Service provides the infrastructure for the
Event and Notification System implementation:</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><i>Figure 3.6: Event and
Notification System</i></p>
<h4>An ACS API provides a simplified client and server API to connect
to the Notification Service and to create/connect/disconnect channels
in the Event and Notification System. This does not hinder direct
access to the CORBA Notification Service to access features not
implemented by the API.</h4>
<h4>The structured-push-supplier / structured-push-consumer model of
the CORBA Notification Service has been implemented first. Other
Notification Service models will be implemented later on based on
specific application needs. </h4>
<h4>CORBA TCL (Trader Constraint Language) query language is used to
allow filtering of messages from clients. Filtering is currently only
allowed on simple CORBA types like Floats, Longs, etc.<br>
</h4>
<h4>Notification Service servers can be federated to guarantee system
redundancy and to provide higher reliability <i>(Provided by CORBA but
not integrated in ACS yet)</i>. Federated Notification Service servers
allow:</h4>
<ul type="disc">
  <li style="">Load balancing. Client access can be split among
different servers </li>
  <li style="">Security. Just specific servers, with a reduced set of
published data (defined using filtering), can be allowed access from
remote sites. This can be used to allow remote monitoring of <st1:city><st1:place>ALMA</st1:place></st1:city>
from <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>
without exposing to the Internet confidential data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Notification Service is a process separated both from publisher
and subscriber. It also optimizes data transfer by implementing caching
to reduce network traffic.</h3>
<h3>The ACS API provides a class for supplying events. An application
instantiates a Supplier or Supplier-derived object and invokes the
publishEvent() method that fills a CosNotification::StructuredEvent,
which is the structure that defines the data sent on the Notification
Channel. The Supplier class takes care of the whole administration of
the Notification Channel including its creation. </h3>
<h3>The ACS API provides a base class for Consumer. An application
implements a subclass of this for each Consumer and provides an
implementation for the push_structured_event() method that has the
purpose of pushing the data in the received
CosNotification::StructuredEvent into appropriate member variables. The
base class takes care of the whole administration of the connection to
the Notification Channel. An application may also utilize the
SimpleConsumer subclass which is able to handle events in a generic
manner and does not need to be subclassed.<br>
</h3>
<h3>The Supplier and Consumer classes have a common engine that has
been factorized in the Helper common base class. In particular the
Helper class provides common information such as the "kind" of the
Notification Channel as registered with the CORBA Naming Service.</h3>
<h3>ACS itself uses the Event and Notification System to provide basic
services like logging and archiving.</h3>
<h3>Comparison between Event and Notification System, Direct Value
Retrieval and Data Retrieval by Event:</h3>
<h4>The 3 data access mechanism provided by ACS have different
characteristics and are meant to be used in different situation. </h4>
<ul type="disc">
  <li style="">With the Event and Notification System, data subscriber
and data publisher are completely de-coupled. </li>
  <li style="">With Direct Value Retrieval, the client needs the
reference to the servant object to call get() methods that directly
return the requested value </li>
  <li style="">With Value Retrieval by Event, the client establishes a
callback-based direct communication with the servant that
asynchronously delivers data to the client in a point-to-point
communication scheme. </li>
</ul>
<h4>The Event and Notification System pattern is convenient when:</h4>
<ul type="disc">
  <li style="">the client is interested in receiving events of a
certain type (for instance event logs, monitor point values or alarm
events) and handling them regardless of their source. Since the
potential number of sources is very large, it becomes very inefficient
if the client must establish a connection to each potential source. In
this case a Notification Channel is necessary as the mediator between
publishers and subscribers. Publishers push data in the channel while
the channel efficiently multicasts events to all subscribers that are
interested in receiving them. </li>
  <li style="">many clients (in particular remote clients) are
interested in the same data. With a point-to-point communication, the
data producer would have to deliver data to each of many clients, with
a potentially heavy impact on servant performances. With the Event and
Notification System pattern, the servant pushes the data only once on
the channel that will efficiently multicast the events to the
interested clients allowing to keep constant the load on the servant.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Direct Value Retrieval and Value Retrieval by Event are convenient
when the client needs to be in control of the rate by which it receives
data from the servant (asking directly for the values, when required,
or establishing monitors with a specific data rate or triggering
condition.</h4>
