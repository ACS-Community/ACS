<h2><a name=LoggingSystem></a><a name=ErrorSystem></a>Error System</h2>
<p>The Error System provides the basic mechanism for applications to handle internal 
  errors and to propagate from server to client information related to the failure 
  of a request. An error can be notified to the final user and appear in a GUI 
  window if an action initiated by the user fails (for example a command activated 
  from a GUI fails).</p>
<h3>The architecture of the ACS Error System is based on the architecture and 
  design patterns described in details in <a



href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD44">[RD44 - <b>ARCUS Error Handling for Business 
  Information Systems</b>]</a>.</h3>
<h3>The Error System propagates error messages making use of OO technology. The 
  basic error reporting mechanism is to throw an exception.</h3>
<h3>The error reporting procedure must be the same regardless of whether the communication 
  is intra-process (local) or inter-process (remote), synchronous or asynchronous.</h3>
<h3>Errors can be propagated through the call chain as an ACS Exception or an 
  ACS Completion to be reported to the action requester <a



href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.3.6 Scope]</a>.</h3>
<h3>An ACS Completion is used to report both successful and unsuccessful completion 
  of asynchronous calls. More in general, ACS Completions are used as return value 
  or out-parameter in any case where it is not possible/meaningful to throw an 
  ACS Exception.</h3>
<h3>The ACS Error System provides a mean to chain consecutive error conditions 
  into a linked list of error objects. This linked list is also called an Error 
  Trace <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.3.2 Tracing]</a>. It 
  is not required that all levels add an entry in the trace, but only the ones 
  that provide useful information.</h3>
<h3>Both ACS Exceptions and ACS Completion contain an Error Trace. The Completion 
  can contain no Error Trace in case of successful completion.</h3>
<h3>Representation (see class diagram for details):</h3>
<h4>ACS Error Trace is represented as a recursive CORBA structure, i.e. as a structure 
  that contains information about the error and a reference to another structure 
  of the same type (the previous Error Trace), to build the linked list. The Error 
  Trace contains all information necessary to describe the error and identify 
  uniquely the place where it occurred. In particular it contains an error message 
  and context specific information as list of (name, value) pairs. For example, 
  in the typical case of impossibility of opening a file:</h4>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>the error message would be: “File not found”</li>
  <li>the context information would be: (“filename”, “&lt;name of non existing 
    file&gt;”)</li>
</ul>
<h4>ACS Exceptions are represented as CORBA Exceptions and contain an Error Trace 
  member</h4>
<h4>ACS Completion is represented as a CORBA structure and contain an Error Trace 
  member, that can be NULL in case of successful completion</h4>

<h3>Inside a process, an ErrorTrace,  ACSException and Completion are typically 
  encapsulated into an instance of a Helper class, in the native language used 
  for the implementation of the process (C++, Java and Python helper classes are 
  provided directly by the ACS Error System). This class implements all operations 
  necessary to manipulate respectively Error Trace and ACSException and a Completion 
  CORBA structure.</h3>
<h3>For inter-process CORBA communication, the ACSException and Completion Helper 
  classes transparently serialize the corresponding CORBA structure and transfer 
  it to the calling process <a



href="file:///G:\Eso\Alma\Acs\Acs\acsdoc\Model\Project\ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
  - 6.3.1 Definition]</a>. There it is de-serialized into a new Helper class, 
  if available. </h3>
<h3>Using this approach only CORBA Structures are transferred between servants 
  and clients and it is not necessary to use Object by Value to transfer a full-fletched 
  object. For languages where a Helper class is available, the encapsulation of 
  the Error Trace structure into the Helper is equivalent to the use of Object 
  by Value. On the other hand, languages where no Helper class is available can 
  still manipulate directly the Error Trace structure. Also, Object by Value support 
  from the ORB is not required. </h3>
<h3>In a distributed and concurrent environment, an error condition is propagated 
  as an Error Trace over a series of processes until it reaches a client application, 
  which either fixes the problem or logs it. At any level it is possible to: </h3>
<h4><b>Fully recover the error</b>. The Error Trace is destroyed and no trace 
  remains in the system. </h4>
<h4><b>Close the Error Trace, logging the whole Trace in the Logging System and 
  then destroying the Error Trace</b>. The error could not be recovered at the 
  higher level responsible for handling it and it goes in the log of anomalous 
  conditions for operator notification and later analysis. This typically happens 
  for unrecoverable errors or when an error has to be recorded for maintenance/debugging 
  purposes. This option is used also to log errors that have been recovered but 
  that we want to record in the log system, for example to perform statistical 
  analysis on the occurrence of certain recoverable anomalous conditions.</h4>
<h4><b>Propagate the error to the higher level,</b> adding local context-specific 
  details to the Error Trace (including object and line of code where the error 
  occurred). The higher level gets delegated the responsibility of handling the 
  error condition. This strategy implies that we might lose important error logs 
  if the higher level application does not or cannot fulfill its own obligation 
  to log error messages (for example because it crashes). It is therefore allowed 
  at any time to log an important error trace (typically at debug level) as a 
  precautionary measure to make sure it does not get lost. Logging it at Debug 
  level ensures that the redundant information is not visible unless we are looking 
  at logs in debug mode.</h4>

<h3>Error Trace, Completion and Exception Helper classes offer operations for&nbsp;</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <h4>handling the addition of new error levels to the Error Trace while an instance 
    is passed from one application layer to the higher one or from a servant to 
    its client.</h4>
  <h4>converting to/from Error Trace, Completion and Exception</h4>
  <h4>navigating the elements of the Error Trace, i.e. querying for a specific 
    error in the chain or for error details </h4>
</blockquote>
<h3>Each Completion and Error Trace are identified uniquely by a pair (Completion/Error 
  Type, Error Code). If a Completion contains an Error Trace, it represents and 
  error and therefore its Completion Type is the same as the Error Type of the 
  top level Error Trace structure.</h3>
<h3>Error and Completion specification is done through XML specification files.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The XML specification files allow defining context value pairs.</li>
  <li>Code generation is used generate type safe helper classes in all supported 
    languages from the XML specification files. </li>
  <li>Getters and setters are generated for all context value pairs. </li>
  <li>Each  (Completion/Error Type, Error Code) pair is associated in the XML 
    specification files to documentation providing help description of the error 
    and of the recovery procedures to be taken<a



href="file:///G:\Eso\Alma\Acs\Acs\acsdoc\Model\Project\ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
    - 6.3.5 Configuration]</a>.</li>
  <li>Help handling is implemented as links to XML help pages. </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Error System provides an API to access error documentation. <i>(Not implemented 
  yet)</i></h3>
<h3>An Error Editor GUI tool is used by application developers defining new (Completion/Error 
  Type, Error Code) pairs and to manage them (insert, delete, edit the description) 
  without having to edit by hand XML specification files. The tool ensures that 
  (Completion/Error Type, Error Code) pairs are unique in the system and generates 
  one XML specification file for each Completion/Error Type.&nbsp;<i>(Partially 
  implemented)</i></h3>
<h3>User interface tools allow navigating through the error logs and through the 
  levels of the Error Trace <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 6.3.4 
  Presentation]</a>. The logging display GUI is used to browse errors and a specific 
  Error display tools is used to browse the Error Trace corresponding to a single 
  error. <i>(Partially implemented)</i></h3>
<h3>Errors have a severity attribute<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
  - 6.3.3 Severity]</a></h3>
<h3>It is important to take into account that exceptions can skip several layers 
  in the call tree if there is no adequate catch clause. In this case the error 
  stack will not have a complete trace of the call stack. </h3>
<h3>Particular attentions shall go into properly declaring exceptions in the signature 
  of methods and in catching them; in C++ a wrong exception handling can cause 
  application abortion at run time. Therefore the ACS error system documentation 
  contains guidelines to follow in implementing proper and safe error/exception 
  handling, in particular in C++.</h3>
