<h1><a name=CommandHandling>Attributes</a></h1>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Security requirements, stated in <a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 9.1 Security]</a> are not analyzed 

  in this document, but there is no indication that they cannot be met with the 

  described architecture.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>Requirement <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 9.2.1. Safety]</a> 

  does not impose any particular behavior on ACS, since it states that software 

  based on ACS has no direct responsibility on human and machine safety.</p>

<p>Software limits will be directly supported in ACS <a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 9.2.2. Software limits]</a>. Applications 

  will handle software limits as alarms on Properties representing the value to 

  be kept within limit. In a typical case, a value with software and hardware 

  limits will be handled using a 5-state alarm (normal, high/low SW limit, high/low 

  HW limit). Reaching a software limit will trigger a callback in the application 

  responsible to handle the limit condition.</p>

<h2>Reliability</h2>

<p>Reliability requirements, stated in <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 

  - 9.3 Reliability]</a> are not explicitly analyzed in this document, but there 

  is no indication that they cannot be met with the described architecture. In 

  particular, CORBA itself has been designed having high reliability and availability 

  as a key requirement.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>The current choices for hardware and software platforms and the architecture 
  for ACS described in the previous sections should ensure that the required performances 
  are achievable.</p>

<p>Basic performance requirements have been verified with ACS 0.0 on the Kitt 
  Peak 12m antenna, with the TICS <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD26">[RD26]</a> 
  and the Protype Pipeline.</p>

<p>All performance requirements stated in <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 
  - 9.4. Performance]</a> are being verified. A set of performance measuring suites 
  aimed at implementing a realistic system in term of number and size of objects 
  <a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 3.3.1 Size]</a> and of number of interactions 
  has been implemented. Discussions and results of ACS performance measures are 
  available in the ACS Wiki page <a href="http://almasw.hq.eso.org/almasw/bin/view/ACS/AcsPerformances">http://almasw.hq.eso.org/almasw/bin/view/ACS/AcsPerformances</a>. 
  This includes a specific feasibility check of CORBA Audio Video Streaming service 
  in relation to astronomical data transfer<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01"> 
  [RD01 - 10.5.9 Data transfer]</a> and tests of the event and notification system 
  performance.</p>

<p>For what concerns generic performance considerations for the ORB implementationsa 

  we use, the corresponding web sites (referenced in the ACS online documentation 

  pages <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD41">[RD41]</a> ) contain a sufficient 

  amount of information.</p>

<p>In the current implementation (ACS 4.1) XML is extensively used for the Configuration 
  Database, for logging and archiving. The performances do not appear to be an 
  issue, but will have to be verified on a lager scale for scalability. Also the 
  use of XML for sampling needs to be verified.</p>

<h1>Life cycle aspects</h1>

<p>ACS is being designed and implemented according to what is specified in <a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 11. Life cycle aspects]</a>.</p>

<p>ACS uses procedures and standards already defined by the Software Engineering 

  working group. In particular the software development process is defined by 

  ALMA Common Software Development Plan <a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD32">[RD32]</a>. This document describes also the 

  scope and timetable of the planned ACS Releases.</p>

<h2>Design requirements</h2>

<p>Different versions of the system can exist in different places at the same 

  time, with different Configuration Databases, but it must be possible to synchronize 

  them (for example, development is done on a control model, with certain test 

  motors, and installation is done on the telescope, that has different motors) 

  <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 13.1.5 Configuration]</a>.</p>

<p>Code does not always need to be recompiled if new IDL interfaces are made available 

  or if an IDL interface is changed, for example adding new methods<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 

  - 13.1.6. Modularity]</a>. With TAO and JacORB even if one changes interfaces, 

  both client and server still work if they do not use the new features. It is 

  possible to have the server exporting one version of the interface and the client 

  use another version. If an interface changes, then re-compilation is necessary 

  (as expected) only for those programs that use the new feature of the methods 

  that eventually changed signature. This should work also with other ORBs, since 

  it is due to the existing CORBA IIOP protocol. On the other hand, this behavior 

  is not explicitly supported and, should the IIOP protocol ever change, different 

  interfaces might lead to run-time errors.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>ACS will be integrated and tested with any software specified in<b> </b><a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 12.3.1 The ACS shall be integrated 

  and tested]</a>.</p>

<h3>Portability and de-coupling from HW/SW platform</h3>

<p>ACS shall be designed to be portable across Unix, Linux and RTOS platforms 

  for what concerns its upper level components <a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 13.1.7 Portability]</a>.</p>

<p>The higher level of software in particular (co-ordination and user interface) 

  should be as much as possible portable and de-coupled from any specific HW and 

  SW platform. This pushes in the direction of the Java language and of the usage 

  of a portable scripting language like Python<a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD24">[RD24]</a>. Java virtual machines and Java 

  ORBs are available on any platform and for any web browser. At present time 

  there are still compatibility issues between Java Virtual Machines (&quot;compile 

  once, debug everywhere&quot; syndrome), particularly on a UI with live content. 

  Most interfaces are not &quot;alive&quot; and do not expose the incompatibilities, 

  but many ALMA interfaces will have live content. Web browsers are particularly 

  sensitive to compatibility problems since they usually incorporate outdated 

  Java Virtual Machines. Experience has shown that it is best to limit the number 

  of target platforms and that real-world Java programs should run as independent 

  applications.</p>

<p>Java performance (initially an major reason for concern) is now adequate for 
  GUIs and for high-level coordination applications with no real-time performance 
  requirements. Java performance is much worse when running on a remote X-Server 
  with respect to a local X-Server and, even more, a Microsoft Windows desktop. 
  Java GUIs should therefore run preferably locally and not remotely. The ACS 
  Architecture has been designed for this kind of usage.</p>
<p>It is then suggested to use C++ in performance demanding applications and Java 
  everywhere else <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 10.3.3 Compiled 
  languages]</a>, with the exception of low level drivers that can be implemented 
  in plain C language.</p>

<p>Java and C++ interface at the network level through CORBA via IDL interfaces.</p>

<p>Portability of C++ applications among different versions of UNIX and UNIX-like 
  RTOSs is improved by adopting the ACE libraries<a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD23">[RD23]</a> 
  and the Posix standard <a href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 10.3.2 
  High level operating system]</a>, although at the RTOS level specific real-time 
  features provided by the operating system (VxWorks for phase 1 <a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 10.5.3 RTOS]</a>) can be used<a

href="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01 - 10.3.1. RTOS]</a>.</p>

<h3>Small, isolated modules for basic services</h3>

<p>Basic services (for example logging and error system) must be independent from 

  the other packages. Also, access to control system data must be de-coupled.</p>

<p>CORBA is very well suited for this, since ORBs are available on any platform 

  and also inside web browsers to provide the basic communication layer.</p>
