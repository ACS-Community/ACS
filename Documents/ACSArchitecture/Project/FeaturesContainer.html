<H2>ACS Container</H2>
<H3>The ACS Container package is responsible for the implementation
of the Container part of the Container-Component model of ACS. This
includes design patterns and high level services to manage the life
cycle of Components and Containers themselves <A HREF="ReferenceDocuments.html#RD01">[RD01
- 5.1.2. Procedures]</A>. This high level management part is
implemented in a specific sub-package called the Management and
Access Control package.</H3>
<H3>Containers are supervised and managed by an ACS Manager. Manager
and Containers cooperate to provide the following functionality:</H3>

<H3>Components will be registered in the CORBA Naming Service.
Properties of Characteristic Components are not registered in the
naming service, but are accessed by retrieving their CORBA references
from the Characteristic Component that contains them.</H3>
<H3>Access to the CORBA Naming Service and Component's life cycle is
handled by a Management and Access Control Interface. A Manager is
the communication entry point for clients: it provides access to the
CORBA Naming Service (with added security, see below) and delegates
to Containers the task to manage the life cycle (code loading,
creation and destruction) of Components, based on the request of
services from the clients.
</H3>
<H3>The CORBA Naming Service is completely open and anybody can read
and write into it. The Manager hides the CORBA NS and takes care of
reading and writing into it under stricter control. A
non-administrative client cannot get access to all information in the
NS, but only to what the Manager provides. Should ACS fully implement
the &quot;authorization control&quot; in the future, use of passwords
and controlled access to the Manager could be used.</H3>

</P>
<H3>The basic entities managed by the Management and Access Control
interface (MACI) are&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Courier New">Components.</FONT></H3>
<H4>To the management system, the Component is an entity with a
lifecycle that has to be managed. Components can be instantiated in
two different ways:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>regular Components</B> are
	instantiated on demand when they are first requested.
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>startup Components</B> are instantiated when the system is
	brought online, i.e. when the Container where they are supposed to
	live in is started.
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>A Component implements the functionality that allows the
interaction between the MACI infrastructure and an underlying object.
The underlying object can be a Java Component, a C++ Component or
other type of objects, for example CORBA services, which have to be
managed by MACI.</H4>
<H4>Every Component has a unique designation. Well-formed Component
designations are Component URLs or&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Courier-BoldOblique"><I>CUR</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">L</FONT>s.
A&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Courier">CURL </FONT>is a hierarchical name
implemented as a string of arbitrary length that consists of the
static prefix&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Courier">curl</FONT>:, domain
identifier and Component name. An example of a&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Courier">CURL&nbsp;</FONT>might
be&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Courier">curl://alma/antenna1/moun</FONT>t,
representing the&nbsp;mount&nbsp;Component for ALMA antenna number 1.
MACI provides name resolution that from a well-formed Component
designation generates the Component reference that can be returned to
the client</H4>
<H4>Regular components are kept active if and only if there are
clients referencing them. The Manager keeps track of all references
and periodically verifies that the clients are still alive and
deactivates unreferenced components.</H4>
<H4>The Manager provides an API to forcefully deactivate Components
even if they are still referenced. This is used when shutting down
parts of the system or when replacing at run time the implementation
of a Component with anew one.</H4>
<H4>It is possible to have &quot;non-sticky clients&quot;, whose
reference to used components is not accounted by the Manager when
deciding if a Component needs to be activated/deactivated. This is
used, for example, for passive GUIs that monitor Components or
interact with them only if the are already active for other reasons.
Such &quot;non-sticky clients&quot; do not force the activation of a
component if it is not already active when they request the reference
from the Manager. In this way starting/stopping a GUI is unrelated
with the status of Components and subsystems can be started up and
shutdown independently from the GUIs.</H4>
<H4>It is possible to define a timeout before a regular Component not
referenced any more is deactivated. This is useful when there are
multiple clients intermittently accessing a component for a long
period of time and we do not want the server component to be all the
time activated and deactivated. Notice that an &quot;immortal
Component&quot;, i.e. a component that is never deactivated after a
first activation even is all clients release it, is essentially a
component with infinite timeout for deactivation.</H4>
<H3><FONT FACE="Courier">Manager&nbsp;</FONT>is the central point of
interaction between the Components and the clients requesting&nbsp;<FONT FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">their
services.&nbsp;</FONT></H3>
<H4><FONT FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">Manager has&nbsp;</FONT>the
following basic functionality:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">It
	is the communication entry point. A client requesting a Component
	service can do so by querying the Manager. Security is tied to this
	functionality by requiring every client to pass the authorization
	protocol and subsequently tag every request to the manager with a
	security token generated by the manager upon successful
	authentication. Manager serves also as a broker for objects that
	were activated outside of MACI (non-Components). It provides a
	mechanism for binding and resolving references to such objects,
	relying on the CORBA naming service.&nbsp;</FONT>

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">It
	delegates the Component life cycle management to the Container
	objects and therefore creates no Components directly. However, it
	does maintain a list of all available Containers.&nbsp;</FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P>The Manager uses the configuration database to retrieve
	relevant configuration for individual Components in the domain, as
	well as locations of&nbsp;<FONT FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">other
	Managers.</FONT>
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Manager is the only interaction that clients have with MACI.
Thus, neither Component implementers nor GUI client developers need
concern themselves with aspects of MACI other than the Manager.</H4>
<H4>Manager implementation is based on CORBA Naming Service and all
references to Components are available to clients not aware of MACI
functionality through the CORBA Naming Service. A CURL-to-Naming
Context mapping allows a one to one correspondence between Components
retrieved using MACI services or from the Naming Service.</H4>
<H4>Manager provides also process control of Containers and CORBA
services, i.e. it will be able to start/stop containers and CORBA
services upon request.
</H4>
<H4>A demon process runs on every host where Containers or services
can be started. The Manager interacts with this demon to instruct it
to start Containers. The demon provides also other services (in part
still TBD) like collection of statistical data such as CPU , memory
and disk <B>load or availability</B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I><B>(Partially
implemented</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><B>)</B></FONT><B>.</B></H4>
<H4><B>Manager can also deploy &quot;collocated&quot; Components,

Container of another, given, Component&quot;</B></H4>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C++ Container<BR>A C++ Container
	is a “porous” Container to allow better performance avoiding the
	extra level of indirection introduced by the tight Container
	wrapper. A C++ Component is assumed to be part of a Dynamically
	Loaded Library (DLL). Whenever the Manager requests a Component from
	a C++ Container, it passes the reference to the DLL to be loaded.
	The DLL is loaded dynamically and the Component instantiated and
	activated. When the Component is released, the DLL is unloaded.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Java Container<BR>A Java Container
	is a &quot;tight&quot; Container. The Java Class for a Component is
	dynamically loaded on request by the Container and unloaded when not
	needed any more. The &quot;tight&quot; implementation allows the
	transparent implementation of the (de)-serialization of entity
	(data) objects that appear in the parameter lists of operations.
	This functionality is very important for high-level Java
	applications. This means that a Java &quot;binding class&quot; which
	is a type-safe representation of XML data is transported across
	processes in the form of an XML string, even though the client and
	server component only see the real Java classes. This is also true
	for sequences of entity objects, or structures that contain entity
	objects. <BR>There will be one JVM for each Java Container. In each
	Container we will have many Components, all running in the same JVM.
	This protects in a better way one Container from another and
	resource balancing is done re-deploying Components from one
	Container to another in the same or in another host. <BR>On the
	other hand, starting up and keeping alive JVMs is quite expensive.
	This is particularly important for user interfaces: a user can start
	at wish many GUIs on the same console, easily overloading the host.
	Therefore GUIs will have the capability of running inside the same
	JVM (when a new application/GUI is started, it looks for an existing
	JVM able to host it. This mechanism is implemented in ABeans 3. GUIs

	for flexible and easily editable procedures. Typical examples are
	pipeline and data reduction recipes. Such recipes are often edited
	by astronomers or by operators also during operation and are
