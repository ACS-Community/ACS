I generally only looked at the sections with changebars.

Reply: OK

(Missing) The Compliance Matrix has been updated in PLA. Please check consistency with the spreadshe
et provided in EDM (via CDR3 instructions)? This table is importnat to check possible backlogs.
I guess this must be the work you have done now, in a separate Compliance Matrix spreadsheet. 
While this is good, it is pretty impossible to use this list as a substitute of 
the R3 planning, because some key columns are missing (see above).
I would have understood that further refinement had to come later, 
provided a first R3 planning would be made available.

Reply:
I will prepare the spreadsheet in the next days.
I did not want to prepare it before the ACS 5.0 planning was agreed, because
this will require changes and I consider it a waste of time.

Action: Fill in Excel table for CDR3/R3

Status: Done

In PLA you should consider fully Japanese contribution (0.3 or 0.5 by
Abe in Japan) and the corresponding work to be done. Check also the
Trilateral Agreement (via CDR3 instructions) for this please.

Reply: 
Accepted, I will add Abe contribution.

Action: Add Abe contribution

Status: Added Abe contribution as "pure on-site support". No
        development responsibilities.
        We will have to see how this actually goes, since Abe is in
        practice completely outside my control.
        For example he is not going to participate to the weekly
        meeting.

p.8 and later (e.g., p.22): You make a point of calling out that not all the
anticipated Socorro machines are available. Is this an actual problem
- I've been purchasing lots of computers lately?

Reply: 
Steve has sometimes problems in running tests having available just 
his own Laptop. 
If I understand it right, it is also difficult for him to get access 
to other machines.
With the increase involvement of ACS in RTAI and if we want to be able
to support TICS we need to have at least 1 additional workstation where Steve
can install RTAI and VxWorks and run tests when he wants.

I think we could leave without the other things initially planned.
If you agree on buying the additional machine for Steve I would 
change the plan accordingly.

Action:
We have agreed that Brian will buy a development machine for Steve.

Status: 
To be done. Brian: let me know when done.

p.25 It seems to me that we can just allocate time for code
reviews. Pair programming might be harder to implement widely.

Reply: 
Unfortunately this is in my opinion mainly due to the attitude of people
and not to time allocation.
For example the missions of Jorge and Alessandro in Socorro/TICS should have been 
a very good opportunity for pair programming, by they have been
left essentially alone doing the porting and testing instead of trying to work 
together with them.

Status: Removed pair programming. Left just a comment saying that we
        (ACS) think it would be good, but it is impractical for ALMA.

p.28 Figure: it would be useful to draw a line delineating the
past/future. Does the figure show planned or actual allocations for
the past (I assume planned). Does the figure include in-kind contributions?

Reply:
I will update the picture as you suggest for the final release after CDR.
Yes, the figure includes in-kind contribution.

Action: Update picture

Status: Added line with Past/Future.
        I have no time now, but I would like to rethink a bit this
        drawing to take properly into account Japanese contribution
        and the effects of Japan.
        For the time being it is good enought, but could be better.

Additional point discussed at the CDR3 meeting:

After R3 we should organize a code revied of Control with ACS and HLA.

Action: G.Chiozzi to organize a code review after R3 contiguous to Leads Meeting
in November in Charlotsville.
